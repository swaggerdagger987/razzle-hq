"""Bureau of Intelligence — Sleeper-connected league analysis.

One file per feature. Each implementation receives a fetched LeagueContext
(rosters + users + transactions + matchups) and returns a typed result.

The eight Bureau features are the "context as a moat" play. ChatGPT
has the LLM; ChatGPT does NOT have your specific league state.
