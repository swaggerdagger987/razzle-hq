# Razzle Company Docs

This folder defines the AI-native company operating system for Razzle.

Start here when designing roles, meetings, model choices, recursive loops, or
automation around the product build.

The Company OS is **canonical**. The prior `docs/v2/` cofounder system (PROGRAM,
COFOUNDERS, BOARD, loop-prompt-*) is superseded — the ethos has been absorbed
into `OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Read Order

1. `STAGE.md` — Where Razzle is right now (build, no-launch, no-users)
2. `OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` — Company principles, ethos, and reconciliation with v2
3. `ORG_CHART.md` — Current six-role company and future hires
4. `MEETINGS.md` — Meeting cadence, three-equals voting, commit gate
5. `SCORECARDS.md` — How roles are evaluated (3-line daily, full grid monthly)
6. `HIRING_AND_FIRING.md` — How roles are created, rewritten, merged, or retired
7. `SOP.md` — CEO-mode operating procedure and old-loop ethos preserved
8. `GUARDRAILS.md` — Branch protection, run lock, prompt-sync, and founder-only boundaries
9. **`HARNESS.md`** — **One-time factory setup** (GitHub, CI, Cursor Automations, Slack)
10. `NEXT.md` — First slice candidates so the team has something concrete to bite
11. `AUTOMATION.md` — How to run the company recursively, "Never Automate" rules
12. `SLACK.md` — Operator cheat sheet: how to start, question, and stop the team from Slack
13. `automations/README.md` — Cursor Automation specs (good-morning, ask-team, good-evening, tick)

Then read the role file for the role being invoked, plus that role's memory file.

## Core Roles

| Role | File | Memory |
|------|------|--------|
| Chief of Staff | `roles/chief-of-staff.md` | `memory/chief-of-staff.md` |
| Product Strategist | `roles/product-strategist.md` | `memory/product-strategist.md` |
| Engineering Architect | `roles/engineering-architect.md` | `memory/engineering-architect.md` |
| Builder | `roles/builder.md` | `memory/builder.md` |
| Data Researcher | `roles/data-researcher.md` | `memory/data-researcher.md` |
| Reality Checker | `roles/reality-checker.md` | `memory/reality-checker.md` |

### Two AI systems — do not confuse

| System | Role | Where |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Company roles (this folder)** | AI staff that **builds** Razzle | `docs/company/roles/` + `docs/company/memory/` |
| **Agent personas** | AI staff that ships **inside** Razzle to users (Razzle, Dolphin, Hawkeye, Fox, Octopus, Elephant) | `agent-personas/` + `packages/agents/` + `apps/api/services/agents/` |

Same word "agent." Different jobs. Both systems coexist permanently. When a
role file references "agents," it means company roles. When the product code
references "agents," it means in-product personas.

## Relationship To Product Docs

Company docs do not replace product truth.

Use these sources in this order:

1. `../NORTH_STAR.md`
2. `../DESIGN.md`
3. `../DECISIONS.md`
4. `../v2/STATUS.md`
5. `../v2/PARITY.md`
6. `../v2/DEPTH.md`
7. `../v2/ACCEPTANCE.md`
8. `./STAGE.md`
9. `./OPERATING_SYSTEM.md`

The company exists to serve the product, not the other way around.

## Current Operating Mode

**Stage 0 — Autonomous Slack workday.** Run roles by:

- Sending `good morning team` in `#razzle-team` Slack — the Morning Standup
  Cursor Automation runs the first Standard Company Loop cycle, opens a PR, and
  merges it if gates pass.
- Scheduled loop ticks continue building while the workday is open.
- Asking role-prefixed questions (`Strategist:`, `Architect:`, `Reality:`,
  `Team:`, etc.) in Slack — the Ask The Team Automation answers from repo
  memory and writes files only when the answer changes future behavior.
- Sending `good evening team` in `#razzle-team` Slack — the CEO Nightly Review
  Automation reviews the day's open/merged PRs and writes the action digest.

Autonomy is the default. Passing PRs can merge without waiting for Founder
review. Founder review happens at night and handles exceptions, direction, and
overrides.

If you want to run a role manually outside Slack, use the `Prompt Template`
in `AUTOMATION.md` against the role file and memory file directly.

Do not automate unclear judgment. Automate stable handoffs.
