# Razzle Company OS

This is the operating system for running Razzle like a small AI-native company.
The product North Star is the CEO. Every role, meeting, experiment, and hire/fire
decision exists to move Razzle toward:

> 1,000 paid users through Reddit-driven fantasy football intelligence.

The company should not optimize for agent count. It should optimize for better
decisions, faster verified shipping, stronger Reddit signal, and compounding
memory.

---

## Stage

Razzle is in **deep build** stage:

- **Product:** ~15% of V1 depth, ~5% of ceiling per `docs/v2/PARITY.md`. Pillars at L4-L5.
- **Launch:** Not yet. Twitter and Reddit launches are deferred.
- **Users:** None. No paid users. No public free users yet.
- **Constraint:** Quality and velocity of slice production at sustainable token cost.
  Not distribution. Not revenue. One atomic slice per morning trigger.

The Company OS is build-coded by design. Distribution roles (Brand Guardian, Growth
Operator, Launch Captain, Customer Voice) are explicitly deferred until launch readiness
is real. Adding them earlier is premature optimization.

When stage advances, `STAGE.md` updates first, then role files. See `STAGE.md` for
advancement triggers.

---

## Operating Principles

### 1. The North Star outranks every role

When roles disagree, resolve in this order:

1. `docs/NORTH_STAR.md`
2. `docs/DESIGN.md`
3. `docs/DECISIONS.md`
4. `docs/v2/STATUS.md`
5. Evidence from users, Reddit, localhost, tests, screenshots, and revenue

No role gets to win by sounding confident. Evidence wins.

### 2. Roles are job descriptions, not personalities

A role is:

- A mandate
- A model choice
- A memory file
- A scorecard
- A meeting interface
- A firing rule

If a role underperforms, rewrite the system before blaming the model.

### 3. Expensive judgment, cheap throughput

Use the best model when the decision could change product direction, architecture,
pricing, positioning, or user trust. Use **Composer-class** models for bounded
implementation that follows a written slice contract.

**Cost is a first-class constraint.** See `docs/company/MODEL-ECONOMICS.md`.
Bad decisions are expensive; so is re-reading the whole repo every cycle on Opus.

### 4. Autoresearch is on-the-job experience

Every role runs the same learning loop:

1. Read the North Star, current status, and role memory.
2. State the hypothesis or decision to test.
3. Do one bounded piece of work.
4. Collect evidence.
5. Score the result.
6. Keep, discard, or revise.
7. Write memory so the next run starts smarter.

This is how roles develop experience instead of repeating vibes.

### 5. Meetings produce artifacts

A meeting that does not produce a written decision, experiment, scorecard update,
or handoff did not happen.

Default is **no meeting**. Meetings are an exception, not a cadence.

Meeting outputs live in:

- `docs/company/standups/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — daily build standup output
- `docs/company/meetings/` for reusable meeting templates
- `docs/company/memory/<role>.md` — per-role learning, written every run
- `docs/v2/COUNCIL.md` — historical product/build deliberation (ongoing log)
- `docs/v2/results.tsv` — keep/discard/crash log (ongoing)

---

## Ethos

These rules every role inherits regardless of mandate. Absorbed from the prior
cofounder loop (now in `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/`) and made canonical here.

### Three equals on the build chain

Product Strategist, Engineering Architect, and Builder are equal voices on whether a
slice ships. **2/3 SHIP → build immediately.** Any single VETO on North Star,
ACCEPTANCE gates, or Karpathy simplicity blocks until resolved in-thread.

Each standup entry must:

1. Reply to the other two by role name.
2. Call out a blind spot, rationalization, or scope creep in the prior message.
3. Vote SHIP / VETO / DEFER / KILL with a concrete reason tied to the cycle scorecard.

Reality Checker audits **after** the build chain ships. It does not vote on intake.
The Founder can override any vote.

### Karpathy coding rules

Apply on every build and every audit:

1. Think before coding — state assumptions; ask in the standup if ambiguous.
2. Simplicity first — no speculative abstractions; 50 lines beats 200.
3. Surgical changes — touch only what the slice requires; match existing style.
4. Goal-driven — every change traces to a slice ACCEPTANCE check; verify before moving on.

Engineering Architect audits violations. Builder can VETO over-engineering even from
Architect. Product Strategist can VETO brand or North Star drift even from Builder.
**Simplicity win:** deleting code while keeping or improving the cycle score is `keep`.

### Compound intelligence

Cycle N must be smarter than cycle 1 × N. Every role reads, before proposing /
scoping / building / auditing:

- `docs/company/memory/<role>.md` — what this role learned in prior runs
- `docs/v2/results.tsv` — keep/discard/crash log
- Recent files in `docs/company/standups/`

Reuse wins. Never repeat discarded ideas without new evidence.

### Commit gate (non-negotiable)

Uncommitted code is decay. Unpushed code is decay.

Every cycle ends with:

1. `git add -A && git commit` — slice-scoped message, no emojis.
2. `git push` — local-only commits die if the laptop dies.
3. `results.tsv` row with real 7-char commit hash. `none` is invalid for `keep`.

If commit fails, fix and commit again before the next cycle. Builder is the default
committer; Reality Checker verifies `git status --porcelain` is clean.

`discard` and `crash` outcomes still commit (the revert or a docs-only failure log).
The repo never sits dirty across cycles.

### Quality bar

Every slice must eventually be **screenshot-worthy or bot-fact-worthy** per
`docs/v2/REDDIT.md`, even if not posted yet. This is the build-stage proxy for "did
we ship something a dynasty Reddit user would care about." Posting itself is deferred.

Voice: fantasy-first. Never "AI" in user-facing copy. See `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### Joy of a truly finished product

Half-done is worse than deleted. Cofounders are not scored on agreeing or
disagreeing — they are scored on whether the product feels finished on Sunday
morning. A board meeting that deletes bad code is a win. A standup that produces
elegant artifacts without execution is a loss.

### Never stop, never print PRODUCT COMPLETE

When `docs/v2/FEATURES.md` is all GREEN, climb DEPTH layers in `docs/v2/PARITY.md`.
The product deepens until the Founder stops the loop. No "should I continue?"
between cycles.

## Initial Company

Start with six roles:

| Role | Primary model | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Chief of Staff | `claude-opus-4-7-thinking-xhigh` for board calls, `gpt-5.5-medium` for routine ops | Coordinates the company and prevents drift |
| Product Strategist | `claude-opus-4-7-thinking-xhigh` | Product mistakes kill companies |
| Engineering Architect | `gpt-5.3-codex` | Architecture, code health, migration, tests |
| Builder | `composer-2.5-fast` | Cheap, high-volume implementation |
| Data Researcher | `gpt-5.5-medium`, escalate to Opus for synthesis | Reddit intelligence and market signal |
| Reality Checker | `gpt-5.3-codex` | Adversarial verification before belief |

Distribution roles (Brand Guardian, Growth Operator, Launch Captain, Customer Voice)
are explicitly deferred. See `STAGE.md` for when they unlock.

Until then, Product Strategist owns product voice and Data Researcher owns raw
outside-reality signal that feeds the build queue (not posting).

---

## Role Lifecycle

### Hiring

Create a role when all are true:

- A repeated decision or workflow needs an owner.
- Existing roles are producing diluted or inconsistent output for that work.
- The role has a measurable scorecard.
- The role can write memory that compounds over time.

Do not create roles for one-off tasks. Use a temporary subagent instead.

### Trial period

Every new role gets three meaningful runs.

After each run, score:

- Did it improve a decision?
- Did it produce evidence?
- Did it reduce founder load?
- Did it avoid scope creep?
- Did it write reusable memory?

After three runs, keep, rewrite, merge, downgrade, or fire.

### Firing

Firing means changing the role system:

1. Rewrite the job description.
2. Swap the model.
3. Narrow the mandate.
4. Merge with another role.
5. Retire the role.

Never keep a role because it is familiar. Never fire a role without checking
whether the prompt, scorecard, or meeting context caused the failure.

## Decision Rights

| Decision | Owner | Required review |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Product priority | Product Strategist | Chief of Staff, Reality Checker |
| Architecture | Engineering Architect | Reality Checker |
| Implementation | Builder | Engineering Architect |
| Ship readiness | Reality Checker | Chief of Staff |
| Reddit positioning | Data Researcher | Product Strategist |
| Role changes | Chief of Staff | Founder |
| Irreversible company direction | Founder | Product Strategist, Engineering Architect |

The Founder can override any role, but overrides should be written down when they
change product direction or operating policy.

---

## Company Memory

Memory files exist from day 1. They are append-only. Each role's autoresearch loop
writes to its memory file at the end of every run.

```text
docs/company/memory/
  chief-of-staff.md
  product-strategist.md
  engineering-architect.md
  builder.md
  data-researcher.md
  reality-checker.md
  decisions.tsv         (added when first non-trivial company decision is logged)
  role-scorecards.tsv   (added when first monthly Hiring/Firing review runs)
```

Memory automation (auto-append, summarization, search) is deferred until manual
entries prove load-bearing. The files themselves are not deferred — without them,
nothing compounds.

A good memory entry changes future behavior. A bad memory entry is a diary.

---

## Reconciliation

The prior `docs/v2/` cofounder system is superseded by `docs/company/`. All
retired files live in `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/` pending deletion.

| Old doc (now in graveyard) | New home |
|----------------------------|----------|
| `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/PROGRAM.md` | `OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` (Stage + Ethos) + `AUTOMATION.md` (loop) |
| `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/COFOUNDERS.md` | `OPERATING_SYSTEM.md` (Ethos: three equals) + `ORG_CHART.md` |
| `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/BOARD.md` | `MEETINGS.md` (Founder Board) |
| `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/loop-prompt-continuous.txt` | `AUTOMATION.md` (Standard Company Loop + Prompt Template) |
| `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/loop-prompt-board.txt` | `AUTOMATION.md` (Founder Board prompt section) |

See `graveyard/v2-cofounder-loop/RETIRED.md` for deletion rules.

`docs/v2/COUNCIL.md` and `docs/v2/results.tsv` continue as **ongoing logs** — they
are not deprecated, just no longer the canonical operating layer. New entries in
COUNCIL.md should be linked from the relevant standup file in
`docs/company/standups/`.

---

## First Automation Target

The first automated company workflow should be:

1. Chief of Staff reads status and opens a daily build agenda.
2. Product Strategist picks one North-Star-aligned slice.
3. Engineering Architect scopes the implementation boundary.
4. Builder implements the slice.
5. Reality Checker verifies tests, screenshots, and regressions.
6. Chief of Staff logs result and next handoff.

This is the smallest complete company loop. Marketing/research loops can run in
parallel once the build loop is reliable.

---

## Non-Goals

- Do not create a fake 30-person company.
- Do not run meetings that produce no artifacts.
- Do not let marketing automation outrank product quality before launch.
- Do not let code volume count as progress.
- Do not let cheap models make expensive decisions without review.
- Do not confuse agent autonomy with founder abdication.

The Founder owns taste. The Company OS creates leverage.
