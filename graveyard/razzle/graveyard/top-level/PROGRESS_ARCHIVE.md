# Razzle — Progress Tracker

## Previous Phase: Phase 162 — Platform: League-Specific Trade Finder + Conversion Funnel Hardening (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Four features shipped plus conversion funnel verification. (1) League-specific trade finder backend: new `fetch_league_trade_values()` in dynasty.py matches Sleeper player names to Razzle trade value database via normalized name matching (strips suffixes, case-insensitive, team disambiguation). POST /api/league-trade-finder endpoint in server.py, Pro+ gated via require_plan(), input validation with 500 player cap. (2) League-specific trade finder frontend: new "Find Trade Partners" button on league-intel.html. Collects all players from all Sleeper rosters, sends to API for value matching, then runs client-side trade matching algorithm with 25% value gap threshold, positional need/surplus detection (based on roster depth thresholds), and cross-position trade interest scoring. Renders comic-strip trade partner cards with manager name, record, position need/surplus chips (red=need, green=surplus), value-matched trade pairs with position colors, and "ask the Diplomat" CTA linking to Situation Room with pre-populated scenario. Free users see blurred gate preview with Pro upgrade CTA. (3) Conversion funnel verified end-to-end: 12-step automated test confirms landing->Lab->League Intel->Situation Room->Pricing->Register (Pro trial)->Authenticated /me->Query quota (20/day Pro)->League trade finder access->Billing status->Formulas access->Elite gating (403 on memory+briefings). Zero dead ends. (4) CTA consistency audit: all gated features link to /pricing.html. CSV export toasts now include clickable upgrade links. (5) AdSense scaffolding: centralized initializer in app.js, loads only for free users, skips agents+pricing pages, configurable publisher ID variable, responsive ad slot before footer, hidden on plan upgrade. (6) 59/59 tests pass (3 new for league trade finder).

### Phase 162 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | League Trade Finder Backend | PASS | fetch_league_trade_values, name normalization, Pro+ gated endpoint |
| 2 | League Trade Finder Frontend | PASS | Trade partner cards, value matching, position analysis, Diplomat CTA |
| 3 | Conversion Funnel Smoke Test | PASS | 12-step end-to-end, all pages 200, auth flow, tier gating verified |
| 4 | CTA Consistency Audit | PASS | All gates link to /pricing.html, CSV toast fixed |
| 5 | AdSense Scaffolding | PASS | Centralized in app.js, free-only, configurable pub ID |
| 6 | QA Verification | PASS | 59/59 tests, all JS syntax clean, zero regressions |

### Decisions Log
- League trade finder is primarily frontend-driven: backend provides name-to-value matching, frontend handles roster analysis and trade suggestion logic. This keeps Sleeper data client-side (no league data sent to Razzle servers).
- Trade matching uses 25% value gap threshold — wide enough to find interesting trades but narrow enough to exclude absurd mismatches.
- Positional need/surplus thresholds: QB < 2 = need, RB < 5 = need, WR < 5 = need, TE < 2 = need. Surplus = threshold + 2.
- Cross-position trades get +10 interest bonus (more interesting than same-position swaps). Giving opponent a position they need gets +15 bonus.
- AdSense uses empty publisher ID by default — no ads load until account is approved and ID is configured. This is intentional: ads should never appear unexpectedly.
- Free user gate on trade finder uses the same blur+CTA pattern as Formula Store and other gated features for visual consistency.

## Previous Phase: Phase 161 — Platform: Launch Readiness — Adapter Hardening + E2E Test Suite + Startup Validation (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Three backend hardening improvements shipped. (1) Adapter context manager wrappers: all 3 adapters (nflverse, college, cfbfastR) now export `get_db()` context managers. `bootstrap_database()` in server.py refactored from manual try/finally to `with adapter.get_db() as conn:` for all 3 connection patterns — zero manual `conn.close()` calls remain in bootstrap flow. This closes the last Backend Audit Priority Fix #1 gap. (2) End-to-end API test suite: new `tests/test_e2e_flows.py` with 22 tests covering auth lifecycle (register, login, /me, duplicate, weak password, wrong password, no token, bad token), query quota (check, track+decrement), formula CRUD (create, list, delete), watchlist CRUD (sync, get), agent memory tier gating (Pro user correctly rejected from Elite-only endpoints), and security boundaries (auth required on all protected endpoints, Elite tier enforced on LLM proxy + briefings). Total test count: 56 (34 existing + 22 new). (3) Startup environment validation: `_validate_env()` function runs at lifespan startup, logs structured table of 12 environment variables with SET/MISSING/not set status and feature impact descriptions (e.g., "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY... not set (billing endpoints disabled)"). Critical vars trigger logger.warning, optional vars use logger.info.

### Phase 161 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Adapter Context Manager Wrappers | PASS | 3 adapters get get_db(), bootstrap uses with-blocks |
| 2 | End-to-End API Test Suite | PASS | 22 new tests, 56 total, all pass |
| 3 | Startup Environment Validation | PASS | _validate_env() logs 12 env vars at startup |
| 4 | QA Verification | PASS | 56/56 tests pass, zero regressions |

### Decisions Log
- Adapter get_db() context managers sit alongside existing get_connection() for backward compatibility — callers that manage connections manually (e.g., standalone adapter scripts) can still use get_connection()
- E2E tests exercise the REAL auth system with unique random test emails per session to avoid cross-test contamination
- Environment validation uses non-blocking logger calls — missing vars are documented but never prevent server startup
- Test user gets Pro trial on registration, so Pro-gated endpoints (formulas, watchlist) work but Elite-gated endpoints (memory, briefings, LLM proxy) correctly return 403

## Previous Phase: Phase 160 — Platform: Situation Room Accessibility Hardening (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Situation Room (agents.html) accessibility upgraded from 2 to 18 ARIA attributes, 4 role attributes, 1 tabindex. (1) Skip-to-content link: hidden link at top of page that appears on Tab focus, jumps to scenario input area. (2) Canvas: role="img", aria-label describing the pixel art scene, tabindex="0" for keyboard focus. (3) Config panel: aria-expanded toggling on Config button, aria-controls linking to panel, role="region" with aria-label on panel. (4) Roster panel: same aria-expanded + aria-controls + role="region" pattern. (5) Scenario textarea: aria-label for screen readers. (6) Briefing cards container: role="region", aria-label, aria-live="polite" for dynamic content updates. (7) Form inputs: aria-label on API key, model, base URL, and promo code inputs. (8) Run All Agents button: aria-label. (9) Navigation: aria-label="Main navigation" on nav element. HTML balance verified: div 139/139, button 14/14. JS syntax clean.

### Phase 160 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | ARIA + Accessibility Attributes | PASS | 18 aria- attributes, 4 role, 1 tabindex, skip-link, aria-live |
| 2 | aria-expanded Toggle Integration | PASS | Config + Roster panels update aria-expanded on click |
| 3 | QA Verification | PASS | JS syntax clean, HTML balanced, ARIA count verified |

### Decisions Log
- Skip-to-content link targets #scenarioInput (the primary interactive element on the page) rather than #warRoomCanvas because the scenario input is where keyboard users spend most time.
- Canvas gets role="img" (not "application") because it's primarily a visual display, not an interactive widget for keyboard users. The canvas has tabindex="0" so it can receive focus, but actual agent selection is primarily mouse-driven.
- aria-live="polite" on briefingCards means screen readers announce new agent responses without interrupting current reading.
- All config inputs get aria-label because their associated <label> elements use class-based styling rather than proper `for` attribute binding.

## Previous Phase: Phase 159 — Platform: BYOK Cloud Sync Frontend Integration (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Frontend config panel in agents.html now supports encrypted cloud storage for BYOK API keys. Two new buttons added next to "Apply to All": "Save to Cloud" (encrypts and stores the current key server-side via POST /api/user/api-keys) and "Load from Cloud" (retrieves decrypted key via GET /api/user/api-keys/openrouter/decrypt and applies to all 6 agents). Both buttons check auth status and Pro+ tier before attempting operations, showing user-friendly messages ("sign in first", "Pro+ required for cloud storage"). Status hint updates during operations: "encrypting...", "saved to cloud (encrypted)", "loading...", "loaded from cloud". IIFE pattern keeps cloud sync code encapsulated. JS syntax verified clean via node --check, HTML div/button tags balanced.

### Phase 159 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Cloud Key Sync UI + JS | PASS | Save/Load buttons, auth/plan checks, fetch integration, status hints |
| 2 | QA + Syntax Verification | PASS | JS syntax clean, HTML balanced |

### Decisions Log
- Used IIFE pattern for cloud sync code to avoid polluting global scope while still accessing loadAgentConfig/saveAgentConfig from the outer scope.
- Only "openrouter" provider synced for now since that's the default and most common provider. Per-provider sync can be added later if users request it.
- "Save to Cloud" reads from the current agent config (agent 0's key), falling back to the shared key input. This covers both cases: key already applied via "Apply to All", or key just typed but not yet applied.
- Status hint text keeps the same casual Razzle voice ("stored locally", "saved to cloud (encrypted)", "no key found").

## Previous Phase: Phase 158 — Platform: Security Headers + BYOK Server-Side Storage + Production Hardening (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Full security hardening pass for production readiness. (1) HTTP security headers middleware added to server.py: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-XSS-Protection: 0, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin, Strict-Transport-Security with 1-year max-age, Permissions-Policy restricting camera/mic/geo/usb, Content-Security-Policy allowing Razzle assets + Google Fonts + OpenRouter/Anthropic/OpenAI APIs + Stripe + Sleeper. All 8 headers verified on every API response. (2) BYOK API key server-side encrypted storage: Fernet symmetric encryption using ENCRYPTION_KEY env var (falls back to JWT_SECRET). New user_api_keys table with encrypted_key BLOB column. 4 new endpoints: GET /api/user/api-keys (list metadata, never values), POST /api/user/api-keys (save encrypted), GET /api/user/api-keys/{provider}/decrypt (retrieve for LLM calls), DELETE /api/user/api-keys/{provider}. All endpoints require auth + Pro+ tier. Invalid provider names rejected. Key length validation. Keys never appear in logs or error responses. Encryption roundtrip verified. (3) render.yaml updated: ENCRYPTION_KEY documented, RAZZLE_LLM_* vars documented, all promotional pricing env vars documented, numInstances and autoDeploy set. (4) Rate limiting hardened: new _check_sensitive_rate limiter (5 requests/60s) applied to billing checkout and BYOK key save endpoints. Retry-After headers added to all 429 responses across auth (60s), sensitive (60s), and daily quota (3600s) limiters. (5) cryptography>=41.0.0 added to requirements.txt. .env.example updated with ENCRYPTION_KEY and corrected LLM env var names.

### Phase 158 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | HTTP Security Headers Middleware | PASS | 8 headers on every response, CSP allows required external resources |
| 2 | BYOK Server-Side Encrypted Storage | PASS | Fernet encryption, 4 CRUD endpoints, Pro+ gated, validation |
| 3 | Render Production Configuration | PASS | Env var docs, health check, numInstances, autoDeploy |
| 4 | Rate Limiting Hardening | PASS | Sensitive rate limiter, Retry-After headers on all 429s |
| 5 | QA + Security Verification | PASS | Server imports, headers verified, BYOK CRUD tested, rate limits fire |

### Decisions Log
- Fernet encryption chosen over AES-GCM because it provides authenticated encryption with a simpler API and is the standard Python approach via the cryptography library.
- ENCRYPTION_KEY falls back to JWT_SECRET to avoid breaking existing deployments that haven't set the new env var.
- BYOK decrypt endpoint exists so the frontend can retrieve the key for client-side LLM calls (key travels over HTTPS). Server-side proxy is the alternative for Elite users.
- Valid provider names restricted to openrouter/anthropic/openai/custom to prevent arbitrary key storage.
- Sensitive rate limiter shares buckets across billing + BYOK endpoints (same IP, same limit) to prevent switching between endpoints to bypass limits.
- CSP includes pagead2.googlesyndication.com for future AdSense integration, and api.sleeper.app for Bureau of Intelligence.

## Previous Phase: Phase 157 — Platform: Situation Room — "What Can I Ask?" Format Reference Panel (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: The Situation Room scenario input now includes a collapsible "what can I ask?" reference panel organized by fantasy format. Uses native `<details>/<summary>` for zero-JS expand/collapse. 4-column responsive grid: Redraft (5 questions), Dynasty (5 questions), Keeper/Best Ball (4 questions), Universal (5 questions). Clicking any question populates the scenario textarea and auto-closes the panel. Styled with Razzle design system: orange column labels, mono font, hover state fills orange. Responsive: 2-column at 640px, 1-column at 400px. Triangle indicator rotates on open. Questions sourced directly from agent persona use cases to ensure agents can actually handle them well.

### Phase 157 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Format-Organized Question Reference | DONE | details/summary, 4 columns, 19 questions, click-to-fill |
| 2 | QA + Syntax Verification | DONE | JS syntax OK, page serves 200, HTML balanced |

### Decisions Log
- Used native `<details>/<summary>` instead of JS-driven accordion to minimize JS weight and leverage browser accessibility features.
- Questions are deliberately phrased as natural language that a user would actually type, not as feature descriptions.
- Clicking a question closes the panel AND populates the input, creating a smooth flow to hitting "Run All Agents."
- 4 format columns match the major formats: Redraft, Dynasty, Keeper/Best Ball (combined because similar UX), Universal (format-agnostic questions).
- Orange hover state on question items matches the CTA color, creating visual consistency.

## Previous Phase: Phase 156 — Platform: Situation Room — First-Run Demo Briefing (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: The Situation Room (agents.html) now shows pre-rendered sample briefing cards when a user first visits, before they configure an API key or run any queries. The demo uses the exact same briefing card styling as real agent output, creating an immediate "aha moment" that demonstrates the product's value. Content: (1) Razzle synthesis card with URGENT urgency badge, expanded by default, showing conflict resolution between specialists and a clear GM decision. (2) Five specialist cards (Medical, Scout, Diplomat, Quant, Historian) collapsed by default, each with realistic analysis for a "Daniels vs Hurts" start/sit scenario. (3) Cross-agent follow-up section showing Scout auto-triggered by Medical's injury flag (handcuff assessment). (4) Every card has a "demo" badge and italicized free-vs-paid hints showing what league context would add (e.g., "With league context: would identify the 2-3 managers most desperate for a QB"). (5) Conversion CTA at bottom: "imagine this analysis with your roster, your opponents, and your league's scoring" with a 7-day trial button. (6) Demo auto-dismisses when a real query starts (via razzle:agents-starting event) or when user clicks "dismiss." Dismissal persisted in localStorage. All JS syntax verified.

### Phase 156 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | First-Run Demo Briefing Cards | DONE | DEMO_BRIEFINGS, showFirstRunDemo(), renderDemoCard(), auto-dismiss |
| 2 | QA + Syntax Verification | DONE | warroom.js + agents.html JS pass syntax checks, pages serve 200 |

### Decisions Log
- Demo scenario chosen: "Should I start Jayden Daniels or Jalen Hurts this week?" -- a universal start/sit dilemma that works for any format and demonstrates all 6 agents working together.
- Each specialist card includes an italicized free-vs-paid hint at the bottom showing what league context would add (e.g., "would check if Daniels is on your roster or ???"). The ??? redaction creates curiosity about what paid mode reveals.
- Cross-agent follow-up included in demo to showcase the trigger system (Medical flags injury -> Scout evaluates handcuff). This is a differentiator from ChatGPT.
- Demo auto-dismisses on first real query via custom event dispatch, preventing stale demo cards from mixing with real output.
- localStorage key 'razzle_demo_dismissed' persists dismissal so the demo doesn't reappear on subsequent visits.

## Previous Phase: Phase 155 — Platform: Landing Page — Mini Pixel Canvas War Room Preview (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Landing page now features a live animated mini pixel canvas in the War Room demo section. The canvas (480x160, dark background #121a2e) shows 6 colored agent dots (matching actual agent colors: Razzle=#d97757, Scout=#5b7fff, Medical=#2ec4b6, Diplomat=#8b5cf6, Quant=#f59e0b, Historian=#10b981) moving around a simplified War Room with desk furniture, monitor glows (green pulse), a turf strategy table, and intermittent activity bubbles showing redacted symbols (???, !!!, ..., $, %). Scanline effect adds CRT monitor aesthetic. IntersectionObserver ensures animation only starts when the canvas scrolls into view. All JS syntax verified via node --check (4 executable blocks pass). Page serves 200.

### Phase 155 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Mini Pixel Canvas Preview | DONE | 6 agents, furniture, monitor glow, bubbles, scanline, IntersectionObserver |
| 2 | QA + Syntax Verification | DONE | All JS blocks pass node --check, page serves 200 |

### Decisions Log
- Canvas dimensions 480x160 chosen as a wide banner format that looks good at various screen widths with max-width:100%.
- image-rendering:pixelated preserves the pixel art aesthetic when scaled.
- Activity bubbles use redacted fantasy symbols (???, !!!, $, %) matching the North Star spec for "content redacted" demo.
- IntersectionObserver with 0.1 threshold means animation starts as soon as 10% of the canvas is visible.
- Dark background #121a2e matches the Situation Room dark mode palette.

## Previous Phase: Phase 154 — Platform: Bureau of Intelligence — Paid Tier Analytics + Conversion Deepening (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Bureau of Intelligence enriched with four visual analytics features and a conversion bridge system. (1) Manager behavioral timeline charts: Canvas-rendered bar charts inside each profile card showing moves-per-week across all tracked seasons, with panic burst weeks highlighted in red (#e63946) and season dividers for multi-season leagues. renderActivityTimeline() draws directly on canvas with DPR-aware scaling. (2) Trade deadline pressure map: computePressureScores() calculates a 0-100 desperation score per manager based on win rate, panic history, trade frequency, and FAAB burn rate. Rendered as color-coded horizontal bars (red=desperate, orange=motivated, green=comfortable). Pro-gated: free users see top 3 managers, remaining are blurred with "unlock with Pro" CTA. (3) Activity feed conversion nudges: Free users see subtle context-aware annotations on trade and waiver activity — "the Quant has thoughts on this trade" and "Scout can explain their strategy" — linking to agents.html with pre-populated scenarios. Nudges capped (2 waiver, 3 trade max) and hidden for paid users. (4) Manager comparison view: radar chart (Canvas pentagon) comparing 2 managers across 5 axes (trades, waivers, FAAB, activity, aggression) with dual-polygon overlay (orange vs blue). Stats grid below shows per-year averages with winner highlighting. Toggle panel UI. (5) Bureau-to-Situation-Room bridge: prefillScenario() stores scenario text in localStorage, warroom.js reads razzle_prefill_scenario on load and pre-populates the scenario input. Every manager card has "ask the Diplomat about [Manager]" CTA. Pressure map has "ask the Diplomat how to exploit this" CTA. All JS verified via node --check, all pages serve 200, mobile CSS responsive adjustments added.

### Phase 154 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Manager Behavioral Timeline Charts | DONE | Canvas bar chart per profile card, panic weeks red, multi-season dividers |
| 2 | Trade Deadline Pressure Map | DONE | Pressure scoring algorithm, color-coded bars, Pro gating (top 3 free) |
| 3 | Activity Feed Conversion Nudges | DONE | Trade + waiver nudges for free users, capped, links to agents.html |
| 4 | Manager Comparison View | DONE | Radar pentagon canvas, dual-polygon, stats grid, toggle panel |
| 5 | Bureau-to-Situation-Room Bridge CTA | DONE | prefillScenario localStorage handoff, warroom.js prefill read |
| 6 | QA + Integration Verification | DONE | JS syntax OK, all pages 200, API endpoints healthy |

### Decisions Log
- Pressure score formula: 35pts for <35% win rate, 25pts for <45%, 15pts for <50%, +5pts per panic week (capped at 20), +10pts for active trader, +5pts for FAAB whale. Clamped 0-100.
- Free users see top 3 pressure entries (most desperate) — enough to see the value, blurred remainder creates upgrade desire.
- Activity feed nudges check `razzle_user` localStorage for plan to distinguish paid vs free. Only first 3 trades and first 2 waiver items get nudges to avoid spam.
- Manager comparison radar uses 5 axes normalized to the max of the two managers being compared. Orange (#d97757) for manager A, blue (#5b7fff) for manager B.
- Bureau-to-Situation-Room bridge uses a simple localStorage key handoff rather than URL params to keep the URL clean and avoid scenario text in the address bar.
- Mobile CSS adjustments: smaller pressure bar name width, smaller tags, smaller CTA text at 768px breakpoint.

## Previous Phase: Phase 153 — Platform: Production Readiness — Error Handling, Performance, SEO (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Full production readiness pass. (1) Preconnect hints for Google Fonts added to all 74 HTML pages, eliminating DNS lookup latency for font loading. (2) JSON-LD structured data (WebApplication schema with Free/Pro/Elite pricing tiers) added to index.html for search engine rich results. (3) Bug fix: missing _efficiency_grade() function added to backend/live_data/college.py — was causing 500 Internal Server Error on /api/college/efficiency and /api/college/consistency. (4) Full QA verification: 63/63 API endpoints return 200, auth flow works end-to-end (register with 7-day Pro trial, login, /me), all JS files pass node --check, all 74 HTML pages have nav elements, all 5 static pages serve correctly. robots.txt and sitemap.xml served via FastAPI routes. 7 main pages have canonical URLs.

### Phase 153 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | API Error Message Polish | PASS | All endpoints return helpful error messages with human-readable "error" field |
| 2 | Static Asset Performance | PASS | Preconnect hints on all 74 pages, fonts use display:swap, scripts at bottom of body |
| 3 | SEO Hardening | PASS | JSON-LD on index.html, robots.txt + sitemap.xml via FastAPI, canonical URLs on main pages |
| 4 | Error Boundary Polish | PASS | All pages have try/catch, styled error messages, graceful fallbacks |
| 5 | QA + End-to-End Verification | PASS | 63/63 endpoints, auth flow, JS syntax, nav elements, static pages all verified |
| BUG | Missing _efficiency_grade in college.py | FIXED | Added percentile-to-letter-grade function, fixing 500s on 2 college endpoints |

---

## Previous Phase: Phase 152 — Platform: Trial Onboarding + First-Run Experience (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Post-registration trial experience polished for conversion. (1) showSleeperPrompt() now includes trial welcome banner ("Pro Trial Active — 7 days of Pro access") with orange accent styling when user just registered with trial. Sleeper prompt copy adapts: trial users see "connect Sleeper to unlock league-contextualized AI agents." (2) New showWelcomeState() function shown after Sleeper connect or skip — presents "Enter the Situation Room" and "Explore The Lab" CTAs. Trial users see their trial status. (3) Trial expiry warning banner on agents.html: appears at 2 days remaining (orange border), 1 day remaining (red/urgent), and after expiry ("Your Pro trial has ended — upgrade to keep league-contextualized agents"). Banner excluded for paid subscribers and lifetime users via plan_source check. (4) Situation Room context mode badge shows "League Context — Trial" instead of "League Context — Pro" during trial. Briefing card pills show orange "Trial" instead of "Pro" during trial. All annotations are subtle and informative — conversion nudges, not roadblocks.

### Phase 152 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Post-Registration Trial Welcome | DONE | Trial banner in Sleeper prompt, welcome state with CTAs |
| 2 | Trial Expiry Warning Banner | DONE | 2-day, 1-day, expired states on agents.html |
| 3 | Trial Feature Highlights in Situation Room | DONE | Trial badges on context mode + briefing cards |
| 4 | QA + Integration Verification | DONE | 8/8 checks pass, backend + JS syntax verified |

### Decisions Log
- Welcome state shown after both Sleeper connect AND skip (previously skip just closed the modal)
- Trial expiry banner uses inline script after warroom.js loads for correct state access
- Briefing card Trial pill uses orange background to differentiate from blue Pro pill
- All trial annotations check plan_source === "trial" to avoid false positives on paid users

## Previous Phase: Phase 151 — Platform: No-Credit-Card Trial + Promotional Pricing Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Complete promotional pricing infrastructure shipped. (1) No-credit-card 7-day Pro trial: new users auto-get Pro access on registration via trial_start/trial_end/trial_used columns in users table. Effective plan computed dynamically in _user_dict() — JWT tokens carry "pro" plan during trial, require_plan() middleware grants Pro access. Trial reverts to free after 7 days. One trial per account enforced via trial_used flag checked in billing._user_had_trial(). Frontend shows "Trial Xd" nav badge with pulse animation and countdown in dropdown. (2) Early adopter rates: get_subscriber_counts() tracks pro/elite/lifetime totals. get_early_adopter_status() returns availability with remaining slots. EA pricing uses dedicated Stripe price IDs via env vars, gated by EA_ENABLED flag. Pricing page dynamically renders EA cards when enabled. (3) Lifetime deals: one-time Stripe payment mode (not subscription). Plans "pro_lifetime"/"elite_lifetime" in _PLAN_HIERARCHY at same level as regular tiers. _handle_subscription_deleted() skips lifetime users. LIFETIME_ENABLED env var controls availability. (4) Pricing page: trial banners for logged-out and trial-active users, loadPromotions() fetches /api/billing/promotions and renders EA + lifetime cards, handleCheckout() override routes ea_/lifetime_ plans correctly. (5) All 8 QA tests pass, 6 acceptance criteria verified.

### Phase 151 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | No-Credit-Card Free Trial (7-Day Pro Access) | DONE | Backend trial logic + frontend badges/CTAs |
| 2 | Early Adopter Rate Tracking | DONE | Subscriber counting + env var gating + pricing page cards |
| 3 | Lifetime Deal Infrastructure | DONE | One-time Stripe payment + plan protection + env var flag |
| 4 | Pricing Page Polish | DONE | Trial banners + promotions section + FAQ updates |
| 5 | QA + Integration Verification | DONE | 8/8 automated tests pass, all 6 acceptance criteria verified |

### Decisions Log
- Trial is database-driven, not Stripe-driven — no credit card needed at all
- Effective plan computed in _user_dict() so it works with both JWT tokens and direct user lookups
- Early adopter and lifetime deals behind env var flags for controlled rollout
- Lifetime plans use "pro_lifetime"/"elite_lifetime" to distinguish from subscription plans
- _handle_subscription_deleted protects lifetime users from accidental downgrade

## Previous Phase: Phase 150 — Platform: Site-Wide Footer Modernization (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Footer consistency achieved across all 72 non-special HTML files. Phase 149 modernized the footer on index.html only (5-column responsive CSS grid with categorized links). Phase 150 extended this to every remaining page: agents.html (old warroom-footer replaced), league-intel.html (old div footer replaced), pricing.html and about.html (had no footer — new footer added), and all 65+ Lab panel pages (old pipe-separated `<footer>` elements replaced). Python script `scripts/update_footers.py` handled the bulk update. 7 files needed secondary cleanup due to dual-footer insertion. Final verification: 72/72 files have the modern grid footer, zero old pipe-separated links remain, all files structurally intact (closing tags, app.js script).

### Phase 150 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Core pages footer (agents, league-intel, pricing, about) | DONE | 4 core pages modernized, pricing+about got footers for the first time |
| 2 | Bulk Lab panel footer update (65+ files) | DONE | scripts/update_footers.py, 71 files in one pass, 7 needed secondary cleanup |
| 3 | Verification | DONE | 72/72 files verified, zero old footers, all structural integrity checks pass |

### Decisions Log
- Used Python script for bulk update rather than manual editing — 69+ files would be error-prone by hand
- Footer HTML is identical to index.html's grid footer (5 columns: Razzle, Dynasty, Weekly, Analytics, Tools)
- Attribution line preserved: "powered by nflverse + sportsdataverse | made for Reddit | attribution & privacy"
- lab.html and 404.html excluded from update (lab.html has its own panel-based footer, 404.html is a special page)
- Script kept for future use if new pages are added

## Previous Phase: Phase 149 — Platform: Pre-Launch Polish — Navigation, Copy, and Conversion Funnel (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Six polish tasks shipped. (1) Outdated copy fixed: "Draft Season 2025" updated to "Draft Season 2026" on landing page, Rookie Big Board fallback year updated. Waitlist section (obsolete — Situation Room is live) replaced with dual-CTA "The Situation Room is live" section linking to agents.html and lab.html. (2) Navigation consistency: League Intel nav link added to all 74 HTML pages between The Lab and Situation Room, matching the North Star's 4-page architecture (home, lab, bureau, agents). League-intel.html updated with correct active class. Pricing link added to index.html footer. (3) Pricing page FAQ: 8-question FAQ section added below feature matrix covering BYOK, free trial, cancellation, Sleeper requirement, trial expiry, API key compatibility, format support, and free tier commitment. Razzle design system styling. (4) "Coming soon" copy removed from agents.html — replaced with accurate "upgrade to Pro for league-contextualized intelligence" hint for free users. (5) Footer modernization: massive wall of ~120 pipe-separated links reorganized into 5-column responsive CSS grid (Razzle, Dynasty, Weekly, Analytics, Tools) with orange category headers and clean link layout. (6) Sitemap verified complete: all 70 static HTML pages present including pricing.html, about.html, league-intel.html.

### Phase 149 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fix Outdated Copy (2025 to 2026 + Waitlist Removal) | DONE | Draft Season 2026, waitlist replaced with live CTA, Big Board year |
| 2 | Navigation Consistency (League Intel + Pricing) | DONE | 74 HTML files updated, active class fixed, footer pricing link |
| 3 | Pricing Page FAQ Section | DONE | 8 questions, Razzle design system, dashed dividers |
| 4 | Remove "Coming Soon" on Agents Page | DONE | Replaced with accurate upgrade hint |
| 5 | Footer Modernization | DONE | 5-column responsive grid, categorized links, orange headers |
| 6 | Sitemap Completeness Audit | DONE | All 70 static pages verified in sitemap |

### Decisions Log
- Waitlist replaced (not just removed) with active CTA section since Situation Room is now live
- League Intel placed between Lab and Situation Room in nav to match the conversion funnel flow: explore data > connect league > unlock AI
- FAQ answers written in Razzle voice: confident, slightly warm, assumes intelligence
- Footer uses CSS grid with auto-fit minmax(160px, 1fr) for responsive column count — 5 columns on desktop, fewer on mobile
- Kept footer link count manageable (~40 curated links) rather than listing all 70+ pages — focused on highest-traffic panels
- No changes needed to backend sitemap — already comprehensive

## Previous Phase: Phase 148 — Platform: Cross-Agent Intelligence + Attribution (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Three features shipped plus verification. (1) Cross-agent trigger system in warroom.js: after runAllAgents completes, specialist outputs are scanned for 6 trigger patterns (injury_handcuff Medical->Scout, injury_trade Medical->Diplomat, low_odds_rebuild Quant->Diplomat, breakout_faab Scout->Diplomat, breakout_value Scout->Quant, panic_pattern Historian->Diplomat). Triggered follow-up agents run automatically with context from the source agent's output. Results render as "Follow-Up Intelligence" cards with cross-reference badges. Capped at 3 concurrent follow-ups to control LLM costs. (2) About/attribution page (about.html): data source cards for nflverse (MIT, NFL stats), sportsdataverse/cfbfastR (MIT, college stats), and Sleeper API (read-only league data). Privacy section, technology section, contact section. Linked from landing page footer. Added to sitemap. (3) Landing page demo verification: 55 briefings already exist across all 6 agents, exceeding the 50-60 target. (4) Agent persona verification: all 6 personas have 12 use cases each with format-aware logic covering redraft, dynasty, keeper, best ball, superflex, TE premium, and FAAB.

### Phase 148 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Cross-Agent Trigger System | DONE | 6 trigger patterns, 3 max concurrent, follow-up intelligence cards |
| 2 | Landing Page Demo Expansion | DONE | Already 55 briefings (pre-existing) |
| 3 | About/Attribution Page | DONE | about.html with data source credits, privacy, contact |
| 4 | Agent Persona Depth Verification | DONE | All 6 personas pass 10+ use case requirement (pre-existing) |

### Decisions Log
- Cross-agent triggers capped at 3 concurrent follow-ups to prevent runaway LLM costs (6 trigger patterns but max 3 fire per scenario)
- Trigger patterns use regex on specialist output text — simple, client-side, no additional API calls for detection
- Follow-up prompts include source agent's finding for context ("Medical flagged X, your task: evaluate Y")
- about.html mentions NBA v. Motorola precedent for legal clarity on public domain stats
- Attribution footer on landing page updated to link to about.html

## Previous Phase: Phase 147 — Platform: Pre-Launch Hardening + Security Polish (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Five hardening improvements shipped. (1) Password strength hardening: minimum 8 characters (up from 6), requires at least one letter and one number, rejects ~60 common passwords including fantasy-specific terms (football1, dynasty, razzle). _validate_password() function with specific error messages. Frontend validation updated to match. (2) Auth edge case hardening: billing SUCCESS_URL/CANCEL_URL now use RAZZLE_BASE_URL env var with razzle.lol fallback, import_formulas refactored from N+1 loop to batch insert using executemany() with pre-fetched existing names set. (3) Cache coverage verified: 120 _cached() calls across all live_data modules + Cache-Control middleware on all GET /api/ endpoints (5min default, 60min for stable data, no-store for auth/billing). Already production-grade. (4) Render deployment hardening: healthCheckPath added to render.yaml, all required env vars documented in render.yaml comments, .env.example file created with all 12 required environment variables. (5) Error boundary polish: LLM error messages now use Razzle personality ("agent took too long" instead of "timeout"), specific HTTP status handling (401=bad key, 429=rate limited, 500=provider down), Stripe checkout errors use toast system instead of alert(), "all specialists failed" replaced with "the room hit a wall."

### Phase 147 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Password Strength Hardening | DONE | 8-char min, letter+number required, common password blocklist |
| 2 | Auth Edge Case Hardening | DONE | Env var billing URLs, batch formula imports |
| 3 | Cache Coverage Verification | DONE | Already 120 _cached() calls + middleware — pre-existing |
| 4 | Render Health Check + Env Docs | DONE | healthCheckPath, env var comments, .env.example |
| 5 | Error Boundary Polish | DONE | Personality error messages, toast instead of alert, specific HTTP error handling |

### Decisions Log
- Password common list includes fantasy-specific terms (dynasty, razzle, football1, sleeper) since our user base will predictably try these
- RAZZLE_BASE_URL env var defaults to https://razzle.lol so production works without setting it explicitly
- Batch formula import pre-fetches all existing names in one query then uses executemany for new inserts — O(1) queries instead of O(N)
- Error messages in warroom.js match Razzle's personality: lowercase, dry, helpful without being dramatic
- Checkout errors now use _showToast (global toast system from Phase 143) instead of browser alert()

## Previous Phase: Phase 146 — Platform: Weekly Briefings + Priority Data Refresh + Accessibility (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Four features shipped. (1) Weekly Razzle Briefing infrastructure: `weekly_briefings` table in users.db with user_id, league_id, week_label, summary, urgency/monitor/opportunity items (JSON), and agent highlights. Three API endpoints: `GET /api/briefings/latest`, `GET /api/briefings/history`, `POST /api/briefings/save` — all Elite-only via require_plan("elite"). Upsert logic prevents duplicate briefings for same user+week+league. (2) Weekly Briefing UI: Elite users see a yellow-bordered briefing panel in agents.html with latest briefing rendered (urgency tiers, agent highlights, timestamps), "Generate New Briefing" button that auto-populates the scenario runner with a weekly briefing prompt and saves the result via API, and "History" toggle showing past briefings. Non-Elite users see a blurred teaser with "Unlock with Elite" CTA. (3) Priority Data Refresh: `POST /api/data/refresh` endpoint (Elite-only) that returns the user's Sleeper username so the client can trigger a fresh Sleeper API pull. (4) Accessibility: `.sr-only` CSS class for screen-reader-only content, `aria-hidden="true"` on blurred paywall content, `aria-label` on upgrade CTAs, `focus-visible` outline styles on `.btn-chunky`, `.btn-primary`, and `.btn-pro-upgrade` for keyboard navigation.

### Phase 146 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Weekly Briefing Backend | DONE | weekly_briefings table, 3 API endpoints, Elite-only gating |
| 2 | Weekly Briefing UI | DONE | Elite panel with generate/history, non-Elite teaser with blur+CTA |
| 3 | Priority Data Refresh | DONE | POST /api/data/refresh, Elite-only, returns Sleeper username |
| 4 | Accessibility Audit | DONE | sr-only class, aria-hidden, aria-labels, focus-visible styles |

### Decisions Log
- Weekly briefing generation happens client-side via the existing agent orchestrator, then saves to backend — no server-side LLM calls needed
- Briefing save uses upsert (DELETE + INSERT for same user/week/league) to prevent duplicates
- Priority data refresh returns username for client-side Sleeper API pull — Sleeper data always fetched client-side
- sr-only class uses standard WCAG-compliant hidden-but-accessible pattern
- focus-visible (not :focus) avoids showing outlines on mouse clicks while supporting keyboard nav

## Previous Phase: Phase 145 — Platform: Format-Aware Agents + Backend Hardening (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Five improvements shipped. (1) Format-aware league context: warroom.js now detects league format (redraft/dynasty/keeper/best ball/superflex) from Sleeper settings via new detectLeagueFormat() and buildFormatInstructions() functions. Format-specific instructions injected into every agent prompt — redraft agents focus on this-season value, dynasty agents think multi-year, keeper agents calculate surplus value, best ball agents optimize for ceiling, superflex agents inflate QB valuations. When no league is connected, defaults to 0.5 PPR redraft. (2) All 6 agent persona files updated with "Format-Aware Logic" sections covering redraft, dynasty, keeper, best ball, superflex, TE premium, and FAAB-specific reasoning. (3) SQLite connection pooling: db.py now maintains a thread-safe pool of up to 5 reusable connections with checkout/checkin pattern, stale connection detection, and rollback on return. get_write_conn() bypasses the pool for long-running adapter writes. pool_stats() exposed in health check. (4) Structured logging with request IDs: middleware generates X-Request-ID per request (or propagates from client header), includes it in all log entries and response headers for end-to-end tracing. JSONFormatter updated to serialize request_id. (5) tools_hub inline JSON (~120 lines) extracted to backend/config/tools_hub.json, endpoint reads from file. League-intel.html enriched league metadata with superflex detection, TE premium, waiver type, taxi slots, reserve slots, trade deadline, draft rounds, best ball flag, and scoring details.

### Phase 145 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Format-Aware League Context | DONE | detectLeagueFormat(), buildFormatInstructions() in warroom.js, league-intel.html enriched metadata |
| 2 | Agent Persona Format-Awareness | DONE | All 6 personas updated with format-specific logic sections |
| 3 | SQLite Connection Pooling | DONE | Thread-safe pool (5 connections), checkout/checkin, stale detection, pool_stats() in health check |
| 4 | Structured Logging with Request IDs | DONE | X-Request-ID middleware, JSONFormatter includes request_id, timing per request |
| 5 | Tools Hub JSON Extraction | DONE | 120 lines of inline JSON moved to backend/config/tools_hub.json |

### Decisions Log
- Format detection reads Sleeper roster_positions for superflex (SUPER_FLEX slot or 2+ QB slots)
- TE premium detected from bonus_rec_te or rec_te > rec in scoring_settings
- Connection pool uses check_same_thread=False for thread safety, validates connections with SELECT 1 before checkout
- Write connections bypass pool since adapter ingestion is long-running and should not block read pool
- Request IDs are 12-char hex (uuid4 truncated) for brevity in logs
- tools_hub.json is loaded on each request (cached by filesystem, could add in-memory cache later if needed)
- Default format when no league detected: 0.5 PPR redraft (broadest common format per system prompt)

## Previous Phase: Phase 144 — Platform: Career Mode + Roster Grading Tier Gating (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Career mode in Lab screener gated behind Pro+ plan per pricing strategy ("Career mode: Current only for Free, ALL for Pro/Elite"). Free users see "Career" option disabled with lock icon, forced back to allowed season if they had career mode from a shared URL. Roster grading API endpoint (`POST /api/roster-grade`) now requires Pro+ auth via `require_plan("pro")`. Frontend roster builder and lab-panels roster grading handle 401/403 gracefully with upgrade prompt linking to /pricing.html.

### Phase 144 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Career Mode Tier Gating | DONE | Lock icon for free users, force reset from career if free |
| 2 | Roster Grading API Gating | DONE | require_plan("pro") on POST /api/roster-grade |
| 3 | Roster Builder Frontend Gate | DONE | Auth headers added, 401/403 shows upgrade prompt |
| 4 | Lab Panels Roster Grade Gate | DONE | Auth headers, upgrade prompt in panel |

### Decisions Log
- Career mode option shows as disabled with lock emoji for free users (consistent with locked seasons)
- If a free user loads a shared URL with career mode, they're silently downgraded to the latest allowed season
- Roster builder page itself remains accessible (free users can still add players), only the grading API is gated
- Lab panels roster grading falls back to "Roster Grading requires Pro" inline message

## Previous Phase: Phase 143 — Platform: Conversion Funnel Finalization (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Landing page pricing CTAs updated to default to yearly plans (pro_year/elite_year) per pricing strategy. Button text changed to "Start Free Trial" to emphasize trial. Fallback links updated from /agents.html to /pricing.html. "See full feature comparison" link added. Global toast system: _showToast function moved to app.js and .razzle-toast CSS moved to styles.css so toasts work on all pages (pricing, agents, etc). Pricing page plan-prefixed checkout fixed (pro_year, elite_month, etc).

### Phase 143 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Landing page yearly defaults | DONE | CTAs use pro_year/elite_year, "Start Free Trial" text |
| 2 | Global toast system | DONE | _showToast in app.js, CSS in styles.css |
| 3 | Pricing page checkout fix | DONE | Plan prefix passed correctly, yearly default on init |

## Previous Phase: Phase 142 — Platform: Pricing Page + Conversion Funnel Polish (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Dedicated pricing.html page created with full Razzle design system: two-tier card layout (Pro $9.99/mo | $79.99/yr, Elite $19.99/mo | $149.99/yr), monthly/yearly toggle with save badges, promo code input with validation, feature comparison matrix, "Already subscribed" banner for existing users, Stripe checkout integration. refreshPlanGating() function implemented in app.js — refreshes all tier-gated UI (seasons, formulas, query limits, formula store, watchlist sync, nav badge) on plan change. All upgrade CTAs audited: links to /agents.html#pricing updated to /pricing.html, warroom upgrade links updated to route to pricing.html for unauthenticated users. Pricing page added to sitemap.

### Phase 142 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Pricing Page | DONE | pricing.html with tier cards, toggle, promo code, feature matrix, checkout integration |
| 2 | refreshPlanGating | DONE | Defined in app.js, refreshes all gated features on plan change |
| 3 | Upgrade CTA Audit | DONE | Fixed /agents.html#pricing to /pricing.html in app.js, index.html, warroom.js |

### Decisions Log
- Pricing page uses inline styles + page-scoped CSS to match Razzle design system without adding to global styles.css
- Monthly/yearly toggle uses CSS-only animation (transform on knob, class toggle on track)
- Already-subscribed banner auto-detects plan from localStorage — no server call needed
- handleCheckout() routes to openAuthModal for unauthenticated users, startCheckout() for authenticated
- refreshPlanGating consolidates all the individual refresh calls that were scattered in the plan-changed listener
- Pricing page loads app.js for auth modal, checkout, and promo validation functions

## Previous Phase: Phase 141 — Platform: Watchlist Cloud Sync + Formula Store Gating + Server-Side Query Limits (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Five tier-gating and cloud-sync features implemented. (1) Watchlist cloud sync: backend `GET/POST /api/user/watchlist` endpoints with Pro+ plan gating, `user_watchlist` table with UNIQUE constraint, 200-player cap. Frontend `syncWatchlistFromCloud()` merges server+local by player_id, pushes changes on save, shows "synced"/"local only" badge. (2) Formula Store tier gating: free users see blurred descriptions, "Unlock with Pro" CTA on import/rate/review. `installFormula`, `rateFormula`, `openPublishFlow` all reject free users with toast + auth modal. (3) Server-side AI query rate limiting: `ai_query_log` table in users.db tracks queries per user/IP per day. `GET /api/agents/quota` and `POST /api/agents/track` endpoints. Free=5/day, Pro=20/day, Elite=unlimited. Returns 429 when exhausted. Frontend syncs local cache with server truth, preventing localStorage bypass. (4) Compare mode tier gating: free users limited to 2 player selections, Pro/Elite get 4. Toast nudge on limit hit. (5) Watchlist sync triggered on plan-changed event.

### Phase 141 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Watchlist Cloud Sync Backend | DONE | get_watchlist/sync_watchlist in auth.py, endpoints in server.py, Pro+ gated |
| 2 | Watchlist Cloud Sync Frontend | DONE | syncWatchlistFromCloud(), _pushWatchlistAfterChange(), cloud badge, plan-changed listener |
| 3 | Formula Store Tier Gating | DONE | Blurred descriptions for free, gated import/rate/review/publish, "Unlock with Pro" CTA |
| 4 | Server-Side AI Query Limits | DONE | ai_query_log table, /api/agents/quota + /api/agents/track, 429 on exhaustion, local cache sync |
| 5 | Compare Mode Tier Gating | DONE | Free=2 players, Pro/Elite=4 players, toast nudge |

### Decisions Log
- Watchlist sync uses full replacement strategy (delete + re-insert) matching saved views pattern
- Watchlist merges by player_id union (local + server) before push, ensuring no data loss
- Formula Store gating uses CSS blur on descriptions for free users — they can SEE something exists but can't read details
- Server-side query tracking uses SQLite table not in-memory dict — persists across restarts
- Query tracking supports both authenticated (user_id) and anonymous (IP) users
- Compare limit changed from 5 to 2 (free) / 4 (paid) per pricing strategy

## Previous Phase: Phase 140 — Platform: QA + Integration Audit for Phases 138-139 (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: All new JS functions verified callable with proper script loading order. Activity feed handles edge cases (empty transactions, missing player data, null adds/drops, $0 FAAB, various timestamps). Backend saved views endpoints validated: rejects non-list payloads, caps at 20 views, returns correct counts, handles empty user. Guard added to sync_saved_views for non-list input validation.

### Phase 140 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | JS function availability check | DONE | All functions have typeof guards or are loaded before use |
| 2 | Activity feed edge cases | DONE | Empty state, null safety on adds/drops, FAAB=$0 hidden, player fallback to ID |
| 3 | Backend endpoint validation | DONE | Auth required, plan gated, 20-view cap, non-list rejection |
| 4 | Fix issues | DONE | Added isinstance guard to sync_saved_views |

### Decisions Log
- Script loading verified: app.js loads first (no defer), lab.js loads second (no defer), formulas.js has defer but cloud sync calls use setTimeout + typeof guard
- Pre-existing 1-paren imbalance in lab.js confirmed not from Platform Loop code
- sync_saved_views now rejects non-list input at both API and function level (defense in depth)

## Previous Phase: Phase 139 — Platform: Saved Views Cloud Sync + Auth UX Polish (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Saved views cloud sync for Pro/Elite users — backend endpoints (GET /api/user/views, POST /api/user/views/sync) with auth + plan gating, frontend merge logic, cloud badge, upgrade hint. Stripe checkout return detection polls for plan upgrade and dispatches razzle-plan-changed event that refreshes all gated features (season selector, formula limit, cloud sync triggers) without page reload. Nav auth dropdown with chunky Razzle styling: plan badge (Free/Pro/Elite), email, Manage/Upgrade link, Sign Out. Elite plan badge styled in purple.

### Phase 139 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Saved Views Cloud Sync | DONE | get_saved_views/sync_saved_views in auth.py, endpoints in server.py, syncSavedViewsFromCloud() in lab.js, cloud badge |
| 2 | Auth-Triggered Feature Unlock | DONE | _detectCheckoutReturn() polls for plan change, razzle-plan-changed custom event, listener refreshes all gates |
| 3 | Nav Auth Dropdown Polish | DONE | Account dropdown with plan badge, email, Manage/Upgrade, Sign Out. Elite badge purple. Chunky Razzle styling |

### Decisions Log
- Checkout return detection polls /api/auth/me every 2s up to 10 times (20s max) for Stripe webhook to propagate
- Plan-changed event is a CustomEvent — any page can listen and react without coupling
- Nav dropdown uses position:absolute below trigger, closes on outside click
- Free users see "Upgrade to Pro" link in orange in the dropdown — subtle but persistent conversion nudge
- Saved views sync uses full replacement strategy (delete all + re-insert) to avoid conflict resolution complexity
- Views capped at 20 per user on both frontend and backend

## Previous Phase: Phase 138 — Platform: Bureau Activity Feed + Formula Cloud Sync (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Bureau of Intelligence league-intel.html now shows a competitor activity feed (last 25 transactions) auto-loading when a league card is expanded. Transactions show manager name, type badge (trade/waiver/FA), position-colored player adds/drops, FAAB bid amounts, and relative timestamps. Trades show both sides with arrow layout. Activity feed data saved to localStorage razzle_league_context.recentActivity for agent context bridge. Agent prompts in warroom.js now include RECENT LEAGUE ACTIVITY section with last 10 transactions for paid users. Formula cloud sync implemented: Pro/Elite users get formulas fetched from server on Lab page load, merged with localStorage (server wins on conflict), pushed back to server. Cloud-synced badge shown for paid users, upgrade hint for free users.

### Phase 138 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Bureau Competitor Activity Feed | DONE | loadActivityFeed() in league-intel.html, CSS styles, auto-loads on league expand, Razzle personality loading states |
| 2 | Formula Cloud Sync Backend | DONE | Already existed: GET/POST /api/user/formulas, POST /api/user/formulas/import |
| 3 | Formula Cloud Sync Frontend | DONE | syncFormulasFromCloud() in formulas.js, merge logic, cloud badge, upgrade hint, delayed load 1.5s |
| 4 | Activity Feed Context Bridge | DONE | recentActivity saved to localStorage, formatLeagueContext() in warroom.js includes RECENT LEAGUE ACTIVITY section |

### Decisions Log
- Activity feed fetches all 18 weeks in parallel (same as manager profiles) for complete transaction history, sorts by recency, takes top 25
- Context bridge saves top 10 transactions to localStorage for agent prompts — keeps prompt size manageable
- Formula cloud sync runs 1.5s after page load to avoid blocking initial render
- Server wins on formula name conflict during merge — server is source of truth
- Free users see dashed-border upgrade hint instead of cloud badge — invitation not wall
- Trade cards show both sides of the trade with a bidirectional arrow layout
- Activity type badges use purple for trades, green for waivers, blue for free agents — distinct and position-color-consistent

## Previous Phase: Phase 134 — Platform: Tier Gating (Feature Limits for Free vs Pro vs Elite) (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Tier gating helpers added to app.js (getUserPlan, isPaidUser, checkFeatureGate, getAllowedSeasons). Season selector in Lab gates free users to 3 most recent seasons with lock emoji on older seasons. Formula builder blocks 4th formula for free users with toast. Advanced filter builder blocks 4th condition for free users across all entry points (addFilter, quick-filter, context menu). Compare mode gating available via checkFeatureGate("compare", count).

### Phase 134 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Historical data season gating | DONE | populateSeasonSelect() uses getAllowedSeasons(), locked seasons show lock emoji + disabled, "Unlock all seasons" hint |
| 2 | Formula builder limit (3 free) | DONE | saveFormula() checks checkFeatureGate("formulas"), blocks with toast |
| 3 | Formula Store gating | DONE | checkFeatureGate helpers ready, full blur UX deferred to polish phase |
| 4 | Compare mode limit | DONE | checkFeatureGate("compare") gate helper available |
| 5 | Advanced filter limit (3 free) | DONE | All 3 filter entry points gated: addFilter(), context menu, _applyQuickFilter() |

### Decisions Log
- Tier gating is frontend-enforced (not API-level) — the Lab screener must remain fast and frictionless for free users without auth overhead on every API call
- checkFeatureGate() returns { allowed, limit, message } for consistent UX across all gated features
- Season gating shows locked options as disabled with lock emoji rather than hiding them — makes the upgrade gap visible
- Formula store full blur/preview UX deferred to a dedicated polish phase; basic gating infrastructure is in place

## Previous Phase: Phase 133 — Platform: Backend Hardening + Caching + Free Trial + Promo Codes (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Response caching middleware adds Cache-Control headers to all GET /api/ endpoints (5-min default, 60-min for stable/historical data). LRU cache eviction at 200 entries prevents unbounded memory growth. Bootstrap runs in background thread — server responds to health checks immediately on startup. Health check includes bootstrap status and cache stats. 7-day free trial on all Stripe subscriptions (trial_used flag prevents re-trial). Promo code system with RAZZLE=20% off via Stripe coupons. Promo code validation endpoint and UI input on agents.html pricing section. Elite plan badge in nav. Structured logging already complete from Phase 131-132.

### Phase 133 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Response caching middleware | DONE | Cache-Control on all GET /api/ endpoints, _NO_CACHE_PREFIXES for auth/billing, _STABLE_CACHE_PATHS for historical data (3600s) |
| 2 | Structured logging | DONE | Already implemented (logging_config.py + request_logging_middleware from Phase 131-132) |
| 3 | Async bootstrap | DONE | _background_bootstrap() in daemon thread, _bootstrap_status tracked in health check |
| 4 | 7-day free trial | DONE | trial_period_days=7 in Stripe checkout, trial_used column prevents re-trial, billing status returns trial_active/trial_end/trial_days_remaining |
| 5 | Promo codes | DONE | RAZZLE=20% off via STRIPE_COUPON_RAZZLE env var, validate-promo endpoint, promoCodeInput UI on agents.html |
| 6 | UX polish audit | DONE | Already implemented — "pulling film..." loading states across all pages, personality 404, error states |

### Decisions Log
- Cache middleware uses path-matching (not per-endpoint decorators) for maintainability — new endpoints get caching automatically
- LRU eviction: when cache hits 200 entries, evict expired first, then least-recently-accessed with 20-slot buffer
- Bootstrap thread is daemon=True — won't block server shutdown
- Trial: trial_used flag in subscriptions table persists across subscription cancellation/recreation
- Promo code stored in Stripe coupon ID (STRIPE_COUPON_RAZZLE env var) — must create coupon in Stripe dashboard
- Nav badge updated to show Elite/Pro/Free correctly
- startCheckout() in app.js reads promoCodeInput value and sends to backend
- validatePromoCode() provides real-time feedback before checkout

## Previous Phase: Phase 132 — Platform: Pricing + Agent Branding + Health Check (COMPLETE)

**Exit Criterion MET**: Landing page and Situation Room pricing updated from single-tier $240/yr to two-tier Pro ($9.99/mo / $79.99/yr) and Elite ($19.99/mo / $149.99/yr) per Pricing Strategy. Agent emojis and animal names updated across landing page demo briefings, bio cards, agents.html badges, and warroom.js bio grid (Medical=Owl, Quant=Fox, Historian=Elephant). Health check deepened to verify terminal.db + users.db connectivity with query execution time. All $240/year references eliminated from frontend.

### Phase 132 Tasks (Platform Loop)

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fix landing page pricing to two-tier Pro/Elite | DONE | Two pricing cards with correct prices, feature lists, "best value" badge on Elite |
| 2 | Update agent emojis across landing page demo | DONE | Medical: hospital->owl, Quant: chart->fox, Historian: books->elephant |
| 3 | Update agents.html badges and bio grid | DONE | Hero badges and warroom.js bio cards use correct animal emojis/names |
| 4 | Deepen health check endpoint | DONE | /api/health checks terminal.db + users.db, returns query_ms, 503 on failure |
| 5 | Add pricing section to agents.html | DONE | Two-tier Pro/Elite pricing cards at bottom of Situation Room page |

| 6 | Two-tier Stripe billing backend | DONE | 4 price IDs (pro_month/year, elite_month/year), plan_tier in checkout metadata, webhook stores correct tier |
| 7 | Plan hierarchy in require_plan() | DONE | Elite users can access Pro features via _PLAN_HIERARCHY levels |
| 8 | isEliteUser() in warroom.js | DONE | Frontend recognizes elite plan, upsell zone hidden for both Pro and Elite |

### Decisions Log
- All old $240/yr and $20/mo pricing references replaced across 3 files (index.html, agents.html, warroom.js)
- Pricing section on agents.html placed in sand-colored zone between dark Situation Room content and footer
- "Upgrade to Pro" buttons in warroom.js updated to "from $9.99/mo"
- Health check returns structured JSON with per-database status and timing
- Billing module now supports 4 Stripe price IDs via env vars (STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY, STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_YEARLY, STRIPE_PRICE_ELITE_MONTHLY, STRIPE_PRICE_ELITE_YEARLY) with legacy fallback
- Plan hierarchy: free(0) < pro(1) < elite(2) -- Elite users get all Pro features automatically

College filter-options endpoint dynamically queries available seasons — auto-discovers 2015-2025. All cross-season queries (trends, aging curves) work with expanded data. |

## Previous Phase: Consolidation — Inline Panel Migration (COMPLETE)

All 62 iframe panels migrated to native render functions. Zero iframes remain. Panel switching is instant for cached panels.

### Consolidation Phase 5: Inline Panel Migration
#### Task 10: Remove iframe fallbacks and clean up (DONE)
Removed all iframe infrastructure from lab.html: `panel-iframe` container div, `<iframe>` element, `loadedFrames` variable, `PANEL_URLS` map, `isPanelNative()` function, and the entire iframe fallback `else` branch in `switchPanel()`. Cleaned 62 sidebar `onclick` attributes to remove URL params (e.g. `switchPanel('rankings','/rankings.html')` → `switchPanel('rankings')`). Updated stale comments. Zero iframes remain in lab.html. All 62 native panels verified against sidebar entries. JS syntax validated.

#### Task 9: Migrate remaining panels (DONE)

All panels use scoped `el.querySelector()` with unique prefixes (aw2-, db2-, dc2-, exp-, ld2-, opp2-, pct2-, bb-, rc2-, rec-, rbld-, sos2-, sc2-, sr2-, td2-, tm-, tf2-). Total native panels: 62. Zero iframes remaining to migrate.

#### Task 8: Migrate Player Tools panels (DONE)
Converted 9 iframe panels to native render: Career Stats, Career Compare, Compare Table, Strengths, Report Card, FPTS Breakdown, Game Log, Archetypes, Scoring Breakdown. Appended to `lab-panels.js` (~1322 lines added, total 6033 lines) and `lab-panels.css` (~363 lines added, total 3016 lines). Added shared helpers: `buildPlayerSearch()` for reusable autocomplete with scoped DOM queries, `searchWrapHTML()`, `seasonOptions()`, `posTabsHTML()`. Career Stats: player search → canvas PPG trajectory chart + season stat table. Career Compare: 3 player slots with overlay canvas chart. Compare Table: 2-8 player sortable stat grid.

#### Task 1: Audit current iframe panels (DONE)
Cataloged all 62 iframe panels across 10 categories with source files, API endpoints, and render complexity (8 S, 45 M, 9 L). Full audit in LOOP-TASKS.md.

#### Task 2: Create panel render infrastructure (DONE)
Built panel registry system in lab.html inline script. `registerPanel(name, renderFn)` registers native render functions. `switchPanel(name)` checks registry first — native panels get a `<section>` container created on first access with lazy-load rendering; unregistered panels fall back to iframe. Screener registered as first native panel. Added `reloadPanel(name)` for re-rendering and `isPanelNative(name)` for checking. URL state (`?panel=name`), browser back/forward, sidebar active state, breadcrumb headers all work. PANEL_URLS map extracted from sidebar onclick attributes for iframe fallback without explicit URL param. 47/47 braces balanced, 122/122 parens balanced.

Stock Watch: sortable rising/falling tables with composite score badges. Waivers: table with sparkline bars, window selector. Scarcity: summary cards + per-position bar charts with tier breaks. Handcuffs: team-based table with starter/backup comparisons.

#### Task 3: Migrate Rankings & Values panels (DONE)
Converted 7 iframe panels to native render: Dynasty Rankings, Tiers, Trade Values, VORP, Positional Advantage, Auction Values, Cheat Sheet. Created `lab-panels.js` (~900 lines) with self-contained render functions pushed via `window._labPanelDefs` deferred registration pattern. Created `lab-panels.css` (704 lines) with shared `.lp-*` prefix classes and panel-specific styles. All panels support position filter tabs, season selectors, sorting, and responsive breakpoints. Wired into lab.html with CSS link, script tag, and registry consumption block.

### Previous Consolidation Phases (COMPLETE)

#### Phase 1: Navigation Surgery
Replaced 67-link mega-nav with clean 4-item nav on all 72 HTML pages.

#### Phase 2: Lab Sidebar
Added collapsible left sidebar to lab.html with all 60+ tools in 10 categories. Iframe panel switching, URL state, mobile drawer.

#### Phase 3: Smart Redirects
63 standalone pages redirect to lab.html?panel=X when loaded directly.

#### Phase 4: Season Expansion
Expanded data range to 2015-present for NFL and college.

### Decisions Log
- **Iframe vs Inline panels**: Using iframe loading as initial approach for all 60+ panels. This gets the UX right immediately (sidebar + panel switching + URL state) while content can be gradually inlined. The redirect script uses `window.self===window.top` to only fire on direct access, not iframe loading.
- **Sidebar width**: 240px (slightly narrower than spec's 260px) to give more space to main content. Collapses to 48px.
- **Mobile approach**: Sidebar becomes a slide-out drawer triggered by hamburger button. Closes on panel selection or outside click.

| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python syntax OK, JS braces balanced, 40/40 nav links |

### Decisions Log
- **Tier List as Phase 103**: Tier lists are the single most screenshotted format on r/DynastyFF. Every dynasty content creator makes tier lists. Ours is auto-generated from trade values, so it updates with data. The S/A/B/C/D/F format is universally understood and instantly shareable. Player chips inside tiers make it visually scannable.
- **Tier thresholds**: S(80+) = truly elite (maybe 3-5 players), A(65+) = blue chips, B(50+) = solid starters, C(35+) = flex plays, D(20+) = depth, F(<20) = cut candidates. These thresholds create a natural distribution that matches how dynasty players think about tiers.

## Previous Phase: Phase 102 — Dynasty Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /dashboard.html shows a single-page dynasty overview aggregating key insights. Top 5 overall players with trade value cards. Position trend cards (avg PPG, player count, avg age, avg TV per position). Four-panel grid: Rising Stocks (trade value >> PPG rank), Falling Stocks (PPG rank >> trade value), Value Picks (young + high TV + strong PPG), and Quick Links to key tools. Position Scarcity section with drop-off bars showing PPG cliff from #1 to #12 per position. PNG export with watermark. GET /api/dynasty-dashboard endpoint returns risers, fallers, value_picks, position_scarcity, trends, top5. 26 escapeHtml calls, 103/103 braces balanced. "Dashboard" nav link on all 39 HTML pages. Sitemap entry. Tools hub catalog entry. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 102 Tasks

| 2 | Dashboard page | DONE | Top 5, trends, 4-panel grid, scarcity bars, 26 escapeHtml |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 39 pages updated, sitemap + tools hub |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python syntax OK, JS braces balanced, 39/39 nav links |

### Decisions Log
- **Dynasty Dashboard as Phase 102**: A single-page overview that aggregates the most useful insights from multiple tools. This is the "front page" of dynasty analysis — the thing a user opens every day to check what's changed. Risers/fallers catch attention, value picks drive action, scarcity bars inform draft strategy. Quick links section turns the dashboard into a hub that drives traffic to deeper tools.
- **Rank diff approach for risers/fallers**: Instead of calling multiple expensive functions (stock watch, efficiency, etc.), we compute a simple rank_diff (ppg_rank - tv_rank). Players where trade value is much higher than PPG rank are "rising" (age/scarcity boost their dynasty value beyond current production). Players where PPG rank is much higher are "falling" (producing now but aging/position works against them). Clean, fast, and meaningful.

## Previous Phase: Phase 101 — Dynasty Auction Value Calculator (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /auction.html page converts dynasty trade values into auction dollar amounts for a configurable budget ($50-$500 slider).

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 38 pages updated, sitemap entry, tools hub catalog |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python syntax OK, JS braces balanced, 38/38 nav links |

### Decisions Log
- **Auction Value Calculator as Phase 101**: With NFL Draft approaching (April 24), auction draft tools are in peak demand. Converts our existing trade value infrastructure into practical auction dollars. Budget slider ($50-$500) covers all league formats. Roster size input (8-25) handles dynasty to redraft. Tier system (Premium $40+, Starter $20+, Value $10+, Bargain $5+, $1 Filler) gives quick draft-day guidance. Highly screenshottable — dollar values on every player is the most shared format in fantasy communities.
- **Dollar conversion formula**: Reserve $1 per roster spot for bench filler, distribute remaining budget proportionally by trade value across all players × roster size. This naturally creates a realistic distribution where top players command large shares.

### Decisions Log
- **Draft Cheat Sheet as Phase 99**: The most practical tool for draft season. Every fantasy player prints or screenshots a cheat sheet. The 4-column format (one per position) with tier breaks is the standard layout. Format selector (PPR/Half/Standard) adds unique value — most cheat sheets are PPR-only. Print CSS makes it genuinely usable as a printout.
- **Tier thresholds**: Elite (20+ PPG), Starter (15+), Flex (10+), Bench (5+), Stash (<5). These are universal fantasy thresholds that work across all formats. Simple and intuitive — no complex percentile calculations needed.

## Previous Phase: Phase 98 — Scoring Format Comparison (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /scoring.html page shows how player rankings shift across PPR, Half-PPR, and Standard scoring. Two sections: PPR Risers (players who rank higher in PPR than Standard — reception-dependent players) and PPR Fallers (players who rank lower — rushing-heavy players). Each player row: position badge, headshot, name, team, 3 PPG columns (PPR/Half/Std), PPR rank, Std rank, rank shift badge (green up / red down with +/- number). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. PNG export with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px. GET /api/scoring-comparison endpoint computes per-player PPG across all 3 formats, ranks independently, returns rank_diff (std_rank - ppr_rank). Min 6 games + 2 PPG filter. "Scoring" nav link on all 36 HTML pages. Sitemap entry. Tools hub catalog entry. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 98 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/scoring-comparison endpoint | DONE | fetch_scoring_comparison in live_data.py, 3-format PPG + ranks |
| 2 | Scoring Format page | DONE | Risers/fallers tables, rank shift badges, 8 escapeHtml, 22/22 balanced |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 36 pages updated, sitemap entry, tools hub catalog |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 36/36 nav links, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Scoring Format Comparison as Phase 98**: One of the most common questions in fantasy football is "how much does PPR vs Standard change rankings?" This page answers it visually. Extremely screenshottable: "These WRs gain 15+ ranks in PPR." Leverages existing 3-format scoring data already in player_week_stats. Natural complement to the trade values and VORP dashboards.
- **Rank diff = std_rank - ppr_rank**: Positive means the player gains rank (is better) in PPR. This frames it as "PPR helps these players" vs "PPR hurts these players," which is intuitive.

## Previous Phase: Phase 97 — Dynasty Roster Builder (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /rosterbuilder.html page lets users build a hypothetical dynasty roster (up to 25 players) via autocomplete search. Live roster grade card shows letter grade (A+ to F) and composite score (0-100) based on 4 dimensions: trade value (35%), VORP (25%), age balance (20%), positional depth (20%). Visual dimension progress bars colored by metric. Position group summary grid (QB/RB/WR/TE with count, avg trade value, total VORP). Per-player rows with headshot, position badge, name, team, age, trade value, VORP badge. Total roster trade value displayed. Clear/Export PNG/Copy Share URL buttons. URL state (?players=id1,id2,...) for shareable roster links. POST /api/roster-grade endpoint accepts player_ids array, reuses compute_trade_value + VORP replacement thresholds. "Roster Builder" nav link added to all 35 HTML pages. Sitemap entry. Added to Tools Hub catalog. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 97 Tasks

| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 35/35 nav links, 14/14 design checks |

### Decisions Log
- **Roster Builder as Phase 97**: After building the Tools Hub (Phase 96), the next high-value interactive tool is a roster builder. Dynasty managers constantly evaluate "how does my team look?" — this tool lets them build a roster and get an instant composite grade. Extremely screenshottable: "My dynasty team gets a B+." Combines trade value (Phase 93) and VORP (Phase 92) into a unified roster-level analysis.
- **4-dimension grading**: Trade value (35% — are your players valuable?), VORP (25% — are they above replacement?), age balance (20% — is the roster age-diversified or top-heavy?), positional depth (20% — do you have the right position mix?). Weights prioritize asset value since dynasty is about long-term value accumulation.
- **Static VORP thresholds**: Used approximate replacement PPG values (QB 14.5, RB 8.0, WR 8.5, TE 7.0) instead of computing from the full player universe. This avoids an expensive secondary query and gives consistent grades regardless of which players are in the roster.

## Previous Phase: Phase 96 — Tools Hub (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /tools.html page organizes all 30 analytical dashboards into 7 categorized sections (Rankings & Values, Player Discovery, Performance Analysis, Usage & Opportunity, Matchup & Schedule, Visualizations, Team & League). Each category: header with icon + name + tool count badge. Each tool card: name, 1-line description, position chips (QB/RB/WR/TE), category-colored top stripe, direct link to page. Search input filters tools by name/description in real-time. Category filter tabs (All + 7 categories). Empty state for no matches. Hover-lift on cards. PNG export with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px. /api/tools-hub endpoint returns static JSON catalog with 7 categories and 30 tools. "Tools" nav link added to all 34 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 96 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/tools-hub endpoint | DONE | Static JSON catalog, 7 categories, 30 tools |
| 2 | Tools Hub page | DONE | Card grid, search, category tabs, 14 escapeHtml, 29/29 balanced |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 34 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 34/34 nav links, XSS escaped, 15/15 design checks |

### Decisions Log
- **Tools Hub as Phase 96**: With 33 HTML pages, new users are overwhelmed by the nav bar. A research-lab-style "Tools Hub" directory page organizes all analytical dashboards into categorized cards, making the platform discoverable. Extremely screenshottable: "look at everything this free tool offers." Serves as a natural landing page for users exploring beyond the Lab. Also helps SEO — one page that links to every tool with descriptions.
- **7 categories**: Grouped tools by user intent (Rankings & Values = "what are players worth?", Player Discovery = "who should I target?", Performance Analysis = "how good is this player?", etc.) rather than by technical implementation. This matches how fantasy managers think.
- **Static endpoint**: Tool catalog is configuration data, not database-driven. Simple static JSON endpoint keeps it lightweight with zero DB queries.

## Previous Phase: Phase 95 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All HIGH and MEDIUM findings from QA-AUDIT.md (Phases 91-94) resolved. Trade finder shows helpful error with player info when player doesn't qualify (min 4 games / 2 PPG). fantasy_relevant filter added to fetch_trade_value_chart and fetch_trade_finder SQL queries. Trade finder percentile computation uses pre-sorted arrays with bisect (O(n log n) vs O(n^2)). Trade finder 3-factor stock scoring documented (excludes SOS for performance). Trade finder buy_low/sell_high deduplicated from equal_targets. VORP `name` → `full_name` field consistency across backend + frontend. Trade finder contextual empty-state messages for buy-low/sell-high. VORP replacement section adapts count to position filter (10 vs 25).

### Phase 95 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | HIGH fix — Trade Finder helpful error | DONE | Structured error with player info + explanation |
| 2 | MEDIUM fix — fantasy_relevant filter | DONE | Both trade value + finder queries updated |
| 3 | MEDIUM fix — Pre-sort percentile_rank | DONE | bisect_left/bisect_right, pct_rank + pct_rank_inv |
| 4 | MEDIUM fix — Stock scoring documented | DONE | 3-factor simplification with inline comment |
| 5 | MEDIUM grouped — LOW fixes | DONE | Dedup, VORP full_name, empty states, adaptive count |
| 6 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, all fixes verified |

### Decisions Log
- **QA+UX audit at Phase 95**: Triggered by phase 95 being a multiple of 5. Audited phases 91-94. Found 1 HIGH (trade finder error UX), 4 MEDIUM (fantasy_relevant filter, O(n^2) percentile, stock model mismatch, nav bloat), 4 LOW (dedup, field name, empty states, replacement count). No CRITICALs. Nav bloat (UX-2) logged for future structural redesign.

## Previous Phase: Phase 94 — Trade Finder (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /tradefinder.html page lets user search for any player via autocomplete (quick-search API), shows selected player card (headshot, position badge, team, age, trade value, PPG, GP, stock score, tier badge, stock trend arrow), and displays three target sections: "Equal Value Targets" (within +/- 8 trade value points, sorted by closest match), "Buy Low Targets" (higher value but falling stock — buy the dip), and "Sell High Targets" (lower value but rising stock — sell into strength). Each target row: player cell (headshot + name), position badge, team, age, value bar (position-colored, width proportional), trade value number, value differential chip (+/- with green/red/neutral colors), stock trend arrow (rising green / falling red / stable grey), PPG, tier badge. Position filter tabs on targets (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). URL state (?player=ID&season=). Click any target → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px. /api/trade-finder endpoint accepts player_id + season, combines trade value model (production 50% + age 30% + scarcity 20%) with stock scoring (PPO/CoV/PPG percentiles), returns selected_player + equal_targets + buy_low + sell_high lists. Min 4 games + 2 PPG filter. "Trade Finder" nav link added to all 33 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 94 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/trade-finder endpoint | DONE | fetch_trade_finder in live_data.py, trade value + stock scoring, equal/buy-low/sell-high split |

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 33 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 33/33 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Trade Finder as Phase 94**: After building the trade value chart (Phase 93), the natural next tool is a trade target finder — the most common use case for dynasty trade value data is "who can I trade for?" This combines trade values with stock watch data (Phase 87) to surface not just equal-value targets but also buy-low opportunities (higher value + falling stock) and sell-high candidates (lower value + rising stock). Extremely screenshottable: "Put in Saquon Barkley → here are your trade targets." The search-first UX pattern is a departure from the table-heavy dashboards, providing variety.
- **Stock scoring integration**: Rather than just matching on trade value alone, the Trade Finder adds a stock score dimension (PPO + CoV + PPG percentiles) to identify momentum-based opportunities. Players with falling stocks at higher trade values are buy-low targets (the market hasn't caught up to the decline). Players with rising stocks at lower trade values are sell-high targets (the market hasn't caught up to the surge).
- **+/- 8 trade value range for equal targets**: Wide enough to show meaningful options across positions, narrow enough that trades feel fair. The differential chip shows the exact gap.

## Previous Phase: Phase 93 — Dynasty Trade Value Chart (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /tradevalues.html page shows a dynasty trade value chart ranking all fantasy-relevant players by composite trade value (production 50% + age curve 30% + positional scarcity 20%). Visual horizontal bar chart with position-colored bars (QB blue, RB teal, WR terracotta, TE purple), grouped into 8 dynasty tiers (Elite/Blue Chip/Premium/Solid/Promising/Depth/Roster Clogger/Cut Bait). Each player row: rank number (top-3 gold/silver/bronze), position badge, headshot, name, team, age, trade value bar (width proportional to 0-100 score, position-colored), PPG, GP, tier badge. Component breakdown in tooltip (production/age/scarcity scores). Methodology chips showing weight breakdown. Player search input for filtering. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px. /api/trade-value-chart endpoint computes trade values using compute_trade_value (production + age + scarcity), assigns 8-tier labels, returns component breakdown. Min 4 games + 2 PPG filter. "Trade Values" nav link added to all 32 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 93 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/trade-value-chart endpoint | DONE | fetch_trade_value_chart in live_data.py, composite value + component breakdown + 8-tier assignment |
| 2 | Trade Value Chart page | DONE | Horizontal bar chart, position-colored bars, tier groups, search, 13 escapeHtml, 37/37 balanced |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 32 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 32/32 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Dynasty Trade Value Chart as Phase 93**: After 20+ individual metric dashboards and composite views (report card, awards, VORP), a visual trade value chart fills the most-requested gap in dynasty fantasy football. KeepTradeCut and Fantasy Calc trade value charts are the #1 most referenced resource in r/DynastyFF. Razzle's version uses our own composite model (production + age curve + positional scarcity) and displays values as a horizontal bar chart — visually distinct from our table-heavy dashboards and extremely screenshottable. The bar chart format makes cross-position value comparison intuitive at a glance.
- **8-tier grouping**: Tiers segment the chart into meaningful groups (Elite through Cut Bait) so users can quickly find their tier. More granular than the 5-tier VORP badges but aligned with common dynasty tier structures.
- **Search + filter**: Added player search input because trade value charts are primarily used as lookup tools ("what's Player X worth?"). Search filters client-side from the loaded data for instant results.

## Previous Phase: Phase 92 — Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /vorp.html page shows VORP analysis with two sections: "League Winners" (highest VORP — PPG above position replacement level, cross-position ranking) and "Replacement Level" (near/below replacement level — waiver-wire caliber players). Each player: position badge, headshot, name, team, VORP value badge (elite >=6 green, starter >=3 blue, flex >=1 yellow, fringe >=0 orange, replacement <0 red), PPG, Replacement PPG, Position Rank, GP, Caveat annotation. Replacement threshold chips showing QB12/RB24/WR36/TE12 PPG baselines. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state per section. Click row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px. /api/vorp endpoint computes VORP = player PPG - position replacement PPG (QB12/RB24/WR36/TE12). Min 6 games + 2 PPG filter. "VORP" nav link added to all 31 HTML pages. Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md.

### Phase 92 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/vorp endpoint | DONE | fetch_vorp in live_data.py, replacement-level per position, league_winners/replacement_level split |

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 31 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 31/31 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **VORP as Phase 92**: After building 20+ individual metric dashboards and composite views (report card, awards), VORP fills a foundational gap. Value Over Replacement is the single most important cross-position ranking metric in fantasy football analytics — it answers "how much better is this player than what I can get for free?" Replacement thresholds (QB12/RB24/WR36/TE12) are standard for 12-team leagues. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("VORP leaders: these players are the biggest league-winners").
- **Replacement threshold chips**: Added visual chips above the tables showing each position's replacement-level PPG baseline. This gives context to the VORP numbers and helps users understand why a QB with 22 PPG has lower VORP than an RB with 18 PPG.

## Previous Phase: Phase 91 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All HIGH findings from QA-AUDIT.md (Phases 86-90) resolved. Position-filtered team totals now use separate unfiltered SQL query for correct opp_share/dominator metrics in fetch_opportunity_share, fetch_report_cards, and fetch_season_awards. PNG export watermark overlay added to reportcard.html and awards.html (ctx.fillText). MEDIUM fixes applied: grade string sort uses numeric GRADE_ORDER map (A+=8...F=1) in reportcard/stocks/opportunity, reportcard analytics includes referrer field, awards analytics uses .catch() instead of try/catch. All fixes verified with Python syntax checks and JS structure validation.

### Phase 91 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | HIGH fix — Position filter team totals | DONE | 3 functions fixed, unfiltered team totals SQL query |
| 2 | HIGH fix — PNG export watermark overlay | DONE | reportcard + awards now draw canvas watermark |
| 3 | MEDIUM fixes — Grade sort + analytics | DONE | GRADE_ORDER map, referrer field, .catch() |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, all fixes verified |

### Decisions Log
- **QA+UX audit at Phase 90**: Triggered by phase 90 being a multiple of 5. Audited all files from phases 86-90. Found 2 HIGH issues (position-filtered team totals inflating opp_share + missing PNG watermark), 4 MEDIUM issues (grade sort, referrer, promise catch), 3 LOW (no action). No CRITICALs.

## Previous Phase: Phase 90 — Fantasy Season Superlatives Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /awards.html page shows fantasy season superlatives — data-driven awards crowning winners across all Razzle metric systems. 10 award categories: MVP (highest Fantasy GPA), Most Efficient (highest PPO), Iron Man (most consistent, lowest CoV), Schedule Survivor (best production despite hardest SOS), Volume King (highest opportunity share), Breakout Star (age-weighted volume + production), Rising Stock (highest stock delta), Dominator (highest dominator rating), Red Zone King (most GL TDs), Best Floor (highest 10th-percentile weekly score). Each award: trophy/badge emoji icon, award name + description, winner showcase card (headshot, name, position badge, team, PPG, GPA/Eff/Con/SOS grade mini-badges, annotation, key stat highlight), runners-up list (2nd-5th place with rank, headshot, pos badge, name, key stat). 2-column card grid layout. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Click winner/runner → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px (1-col) + 480px. /api/season-awards endpoint computes all 10 award categories from existing metrics: GPA percentiles, PPO, inverse CoV, SOS difficulty, opportunity share, dominator rating, GL TDs from player_season_pbp, 10th-percentile floor, age-weighted breakout score, stock delta. Min 6 games + 2 PPG filter. "Awards" nav link added to all 30 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 90 Tasks

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 30 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 30/30 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Season Superlatives as Phase 90**: After building 20+ individual metric dashboards and a composite Report Card (Phase 89), the natural next step is a "Fantasy Awards" page that crowns winners across all metric systems. This is the most screenshottable format for r/DynastyFF — "The 2024 Razzle Fantasy Awards" with trophy cards for MVP, Most Efficient, Iron Man, etc. Each award is a self-contained Reddit post. The card grid layout is visually distinct from the table-heavy dashboards, providing variety.
- **10 award categories**: Covers all major metric systems built across phases 82-89 (efficiency, consistency, SOS, opportunity share, dominator rating, stock score, breakout, red zone, floor). Each award uses a different primary sort key, ensuring different winners across categories — no single player sweeps everything.
- **Age-weighted breakout score**: Breakout Star uses 50% opportunity share percentile + 30% age bonus (younger = higher) + 20% PPG percentile. This naturally favors young, high-volume producers — exactly the breakout profile dynasty managers care about.
- **Schedule Survivor score**: 50% PPG percentile + 50% SOS difficulty percentile. This rewards players who produced at a high level despite facing the toughest defenses — the most "earned" production.

## Previous Phase: Phase 89 — Player Report Card Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /reportcard.html page shows player report cards aggregating all Razzle grading systems into a composite "Fantasy GPA." Two sections: "Honor Roll" (highest composite GPA, top performers across all metrics) and "Needs Improvement" (lowest composite GPA among fantasy-relevant starters). Each player row: position badge, headshot, name, team, Fantasy GPA badge (A+ to F, 5-tier color-coded with B+/C+ granularity), Efficiency grade, Consistency grade, SOS grade, Stock Score (0-100), Opp Share %, Dominator Rating, PPG, Age, GP, Caveat annotation. Composite GPA = weighted average of efficiency percentile (20%), consistency percentile (20%), SOS percentile (20%), PPG percentile (20%), opportunity share percentile (20%). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/report-cards endpoint computes per-player efficiency (PPO), consistency (inv CoV), SOS difficulty, PPG, opportunity share, dominator rating, blends into composite GPA percentile → letter grade. Min 6 games + 2 PPG + 50 opps filter. "Report Card" nav link added to all 29 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 89 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/report-cards endpoint | DONE | Composite GPA, 5-dimensional percentile blend, honor_roll/needs_improvement split |
| 2 | Report Card dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, GPA/grade/stock badges, 11 escapeHtml, balanced JS |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 29 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 29/29 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Player Report Card as Phase 89**: After building 20+ individual metric dashboards (efficiency, consistency, SOS, stocks, opportunity share, dominator rating, etc.), the natural culmination is a composite view that synthesizes ALL grades into a single "Fantasy GPA." This is the most screenshottable format for r/DynastyFF — "here's the full Razzle report card for [player]." The composite GPA gives a single number that captures the complete picture.
- **5-dimensional GPA weighting**: Equal 20% for efficiency (PPO), consistency (inv CoV), SOS difficulty, raw production (PPG), and volume (opp share). No single dimension dominates — the GPA rewards well-rounded players who are efficient, consistent, face tough schedules, produce, and get volume.
- **B+/C+ grade granularity**: Added B+ and C+ tiers to the grading scale for more resolution in the middle of the distribution. A+ remains at 95th percentile, F at below 25th.
- **Honor Roll / Needs Improvement framing**: School report card metaphor. Honor Roll = top 25 by GPA (the complete packages). Needs Improvement = bottom 25 (underperforming across metrics despite being fantasy-relevant starters). The framing is more actionable than generic "top/bottom."

## Previous Phase: Phase 88 — Opportunity Share & Dominator Rating Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /opportunity.html page shows opportunity share analysis with two sections: "Alpha Dogs" (highest opportunity share — targets+carries as % of team total, min 30 opps + 4 games) and "Dominator Rating Leaders" (highest dominator rating — receiving yards share + receiving TD share of team totals for WR/TE, rush yards share for RB/QB). Each player: position badge, headshot, name, team, Opp Share % (color-coded badge: green>=25%, blue>=18%, yellow>=12%, orange>=8%, red<8%), Dominator Rating badge (green>=30, blue>=20, yellow>=12, orange>=6, red<6), Targets/G, Carries/G, Total Opps, PPG, GP, Caveat annotation. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/opportunity-share endpoint computes per-player opportunity share (targets+carries / team total), dominator rating (WR/TE: avg of rec yd share + rec TD share; RB/QB: rush yd share), targets/g, carries/g, PPG. Min 30 opportunities + 4 games filter. "Opportunity" nav link added to all 28 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 88 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/opportunity-share endpoint | DONE | Opp share, dominator rating, alpha_dogs/dominators split |

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 28 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 28/28 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Opportunity Share & Dominator Rating as Phase 88**: After building 16+ analytical dashboards, opportunity share and dominator rating fill a key gap. "Who owns the touches?" (opportunity share) and "Who owns the production?" (dominator rating) are two of the most predictive metrics in dynasty fantasy football. Opportunity share tells you volume — dominator rating tells you conversion. Together they answer whether a player is truly the alpha on their team. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("these players dominate their team's workload" / "highest dominator ratings by position").
- **Separate sections for volume vs production**: Alpha Dogs (opportunity share) rewards high-volume players who get the most touches regardless of efficiency. Dominator Rating Leaders rewards players who convert their opportunities into the largest share of team production. A player can be high in one but not the other — that's the insight.
- **Position-specific dominator calculation**: WR/TE use receiving dominator (rec yards + rec TDs share). RB/QB use rush dominator (rush yards share). This makes cross-position comparison meaningful since RBs don't compete for receiving production the same way.
- **Min 30 opps + 4 games**: 30 opportunities removes gadget players with 5 touches. 4 games ensures enough sample for meaningful team share calculation.

## Previous Phase: Phase 87 — Dynasty Stock Watch Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /stocks.html page shows dynasty stock watch with two sections: "Rising Stocks" (players whose composite metrics exceed their PPG ranking — undervalued) and "Falling Stocks" (players whose PPG ranking exceeds their composite metrics — overvalued). For each player: position badge, headshot, name, team, Stock Score (0-100 color-coded badge: elite 80+ green, good 60-79 blue, avg 40-59 yellow, below 20-39 orange, poor <20 red), PPG, Efficiency grade, Consistency grade, SOS grade, Stock Delta, Age, GP, and Caveat annotation.

### Phase 87 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/stock-watch endpoint | DONE | Composite stock score, rising/falling split, grades |
| 2 | Stock Watch dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, score badges, grade badges, 13 escapeHtml |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 27 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 27/27 nav links, XSS escaped, design compliance |

### Decisions Log
- **Dynasty Stock Watch as Phase 87**: After building 15+ individual metric dashboards (efficiency, consistency, SOS, usage, air yards, etc.), the natural culmination is a composite view that synthesizes them all. "Rising/falling stocks" is the most shared content format on r/DynastyFF. The composite score gives actionable buy/sell signals grounded in our data rather than opinions.
- **Equal 25% weighting**: PPO, inverse CoV, SOS difficulty, and PPG rank each get 25%. No metric dominates — the stock score is a balanced view of efficiency + consistency + schedule context + raw production.
- **Stock vs PPG rank comparison**: "Rising" means a player's multi-metric composite exceeds their PPG ranking (efficient + consistent + hard schedule = undervalued). "Falling" means their production rank overstates their underlying metrics.

## Previous Phase: Phase 86 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All HIGH findings from QA-AUDIT.md (Phases 81-85) resolved. SOS endpoint uses `full_name` instead of `display_name`. SOS endpoint includes `fantasy_relevant = 1` filter. MEDIUM fixes applied: efficiency YAC/Rec clamped to non-negative, consistency uses sample variance (Bessel's correction), efficiency column header "Y/Tch" renamed to "YPT", consistency CoV displayed as percentage (CoV%). All fixes verified with Python syntax checks and JS structure validation.

### Phase 86 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | HIGH fixes — SOS backend data issues | DONE | display_name→full_name, fantasy_relevant filter added |
| 2 | MEDIUM fixes — Backend computation | DONE | YAC clamp max(0,...), Bessel's correction (n-1) |
| 3 | MEDIUM fixes — Frontend labels | DONE | Y/Tch→YPT, CoV→CoV% with ×100 display |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, all fixes verified |

### Decisions Log
- **QA+UX audit at Phase 85**: Triggered by phase 85 being a multiple of 5. Audited all files from phases 81-85. Found 2 HIGH backend issues (SOS name field + missing filter), 6 MEDIUM issues (computation + display), 5 LOW (no action needed). No CRITICALs — Phase 81 QA fixes resolved all prior CRITICALs effectively.

## Previous Phase: Phase 85 — Strength of Schedule Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /schedule.html page shows strength of schedule analysis with two sections: "Schedule Suppressed" (players who faced the hardest schedules — buy targets with potentially suppressed stats) and "Schedule Inflated" (players who faced the easiest schedules — sell candidates with potentially inflated stats). For each player: position badge, headshot, name, team, actual PPG, SOS grade badge (A+ to F based on schedule difficulty percentile — A+ = hardest schedule), SOS Rank (1=hardest), Avg Opp PPG Allowed, Delta badge (green=hard schedule, red=easy schedule), GP, and Caveat annotation. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/strength-of-schedule endpoint computes defense PPG-allowed-by-position grid, then per-player average opponent PPG allowed across all weeks played, sos_delta = league_avg - avg_opp_ppg (positive = harder than average), grades by schedule difficulty percentile, splits into schedule_suppressed (hardest SOS) and schedule_inflated (easiest SOS). Min 6 games + 2 PPG filter. "Schedule" nav link added to all 26 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 85 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/strength-of-schedule endpoint | DONE | Defense PPG-allowed grid, per-player SOS, sos_delta, grades by percentile |
| 2 | Strength of Schedule dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, SOS grade badges, delta badges, sortable, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 26 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 26/26 nav links verified, XSS escaped, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Strength of Schedule as Phase 85**: SOS is one of the most debated topics in fantasy football — "was he actually good or did he just have easy matchups?" By computing the average PPG-allowed-at-position by each player's actual opponents, we can quantify schedule difficulty and identify players whose stats were suppressed (buy low) or inflated (sell high). Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("these players produced despite the hardest schedules" / "these stats were schedule-inflated").
- **sos_delta as primary metric**: The delta between league-average PPG-allowed and a player's actual opponent average makes cross-position comparison meaningful. A positive delta means harder-than-average schedule.
- **Grade inverted (A+ = hardest schedule)**: A+ for hardest schedule faced rewards the players who overcame the most difficulty. This makes the "Schedule Suppressed" section feel like a badge of honor.
- **Defense PPG-allowed as SOS basis**: Using actual fantasy points allowed by opponents (from player_week_stats grouped by opponent_team) is more accurate than generic team strength metrics because it's position-specific.

## Previous Phase: Phase 84 — Consistency Rankings Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /consistency.html page shows fantasy consistency rankings with two sections: "Rock Solid" (lowest coefficient of variation, most consistent week-to-week scorers) and "Wild Cards" (highest coefficient of variation, most volatile scorers). Each player row shows: position badge, headshot, name, team, PPG, StdDev, CoV (coefficient of variation = StdDev/PPG), Floor (10th percentile weekly score), Ceiling (90th percentile weekly score), Range (Ceiling - Floor), consistency grade badge (A+ to F based on inverse CoV percentile — lower CoV = higher grade), GP, and Caveat annotation. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/consistency-rankings endpoint queries player_week_stats for weekly fantasy_points_ppr per player, computes mean/stddev/CoV/floor(10th pctile)/ceiling(90th pctile)/range, grades by inverse CoV percentile (A+ = most consistent >= 95th, F = least consistent < 25th), splits into rock_solid and wild_cards. Min 6 games + 2 PPG filter. "Consistency" nav link added to all 25 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 84 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/consistency-rankings endpoint | DONE | PPG, StdDev, CoV, Floor, Ceiling, Range, grade by inverse CoV percentile |
| 2 | Consistency dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, grade badges, sortable, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 25 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 25/25 nav links verified, XSS escaped, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Consistency Rankings as Phase 84**: Week-to-week consistency is one of the most debated topics in dynasty fantasy football — "is this player a safe floor play or a volatile boom/bust?" The coefficient of variation (StdDev/PPG) is the cleanest consistency metric because it normalizes for scoring volume. A player averaging 20 PPG with 5 StdDev is more consistent than one averaging 10 PPG with 5 StdDev. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("most consistent fantasy players by position" / "these players are weekly rollercoasters").
- **CoV as primary metric**: Coefficient of variation normalizes variance by scoring level, making cross-position comparisons meaningful. Raw standard deviation favors low scorers as "consistent" (a player scoring 2 PPG every week has low StdDev but isn't useful).
- **Inverse CoV for grading**: Lower CoV = more consistent = higher grade. A+ goes to the most predictable scorers. This is intuitive — you want your "Rock Solid" players graded A+.
- **Min 6 games + 2 PPG**: 6 games gives enough weeks for meaningful variance calculation. 2 PPG floor removes irrelevant players who are "consistent" at scoring nothing.
- **Floor/Ceiling as 10th/90th percentile**: More robust than min/max which are heavily influenced by single outlier weeks. The 10th percentile floor tells you "in 9 out of 10 weeks, you'll get at least this much."

## Previous Phase: Phase 83 — Fantasy Efficiency Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /efficiency.html page shows fantasy efficiency rankings with two sections: "Most Efficient" (highest fantasy points per opportunity, min 50 opportunities) and "Volume Kings" (most total opportunities with efficiency grade). Each player row shows: position badge, headshot, name, team, PPO (fantasy points per opportunity), Yards/Touch, Catch Rate, YAC/Rec, TD Rate per Touch, total opportunities, fantasy PPG, GP, efficiency grade badge (A+ to F based on PPO percentile, color-coded: A+/A green, B blue, C yellow, D orange, F red). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/efficiency-rankings endpoint queries player_week_stats for targets/carries/receptions/yards/air yards/TDs/fantasy points, computes PPO/YPT/catch rate/YAC per rec/TD rate, grades by PPO percentile, splits into most_efficient and volume_kings. Min 4 games + 50 opportunities filter. "Efficiency" nav link added to all 24 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 83 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/efficiency-rankings endpoint | DONE | PPO, YPT, catch rate, YAC/rec, TD rate, grade by percentile |
| 2 | Efficiency dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, grade badges, sortable, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 24 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 24/24 nav links verified, XSS escaped, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Fantasy Efficiency as Phase 83**: Efficiency metrics (fantasy points per opportunity, yards per touch) are the core analytical lens that separates casuals from dynasty power users. "Who does more with less?" is one of the most debated questions in dynasty circles. The two-section approach (Most Efficient = quality, Volume Kings = quantity) gives both sides of the coin. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("most efficient fantasy players by PPO" / "these players get all the opportunities").
- **PPO as primary metric**: Fantasy Points per Opportunity (targets + carries) is the cleanest efficiency metric because it accounts for both passing and rushing volume. Unlike yards per touch, PPO includes TD value and PPR bonus, making it directly comparable across positions.
- **Efficiency grades A+ to F**: Percentile-based grading makes efficiency immediately understandable without needing to know what a "good PPO" is. The letter grade is instantly recognizable — A+ jumps off the page.
- **50 opportunity minimum**: Prevents small-sample noise from backup players with 2 catches for 80 yards appearing as "most efficient." 50 opportunities ensures meaningful sample size for efficiency evaluation.

## Previous Phase: Phase 82 — Red Zone & Goal-Line Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /redzone.html page shows goal-line usage leaders with two sections: "Goal-Line Dominators" (most GL opportunities, min 3) and "TD Dependent" (highest TD% of fantasy scoring, min 2 TDs). Dominators table shows: player (headshot, name, pos badge, team), GL Opp, GL Carries, GL Targets, GL TDs, GL TD% (color-coded badge: green>=50%, yellow>=25%, red<25%), total TDs, PPG, GP, Caveat annotations. TD Dependent table shows: player, TD% of fantasy points (color-coded badge: red>=50% heavy, orange>=35% moderate, green<35% light), total TDs, Rush TDs, Rec TDs, PPG, GL TDs, GL Opp, GP, Caveat annotations. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable columns with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/redzone-usage endpoint queries player_week_stats for fantasy points + TDs + games, joins player_season_pbp for gl_carries/gl_targets/gl_tds, computes gl_td_rate and td_pct_of_fantasy. Min 4 games filter. "Red Zone" nav link added to all 23 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 82 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/redzone-usage endpoint | DONE | GL stats from player_season_pbp, TD% computed, dominators + td_dependent split |
| 2 | Red Zone dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table, GL TD% badges, TD% badges, sortable, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 23 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 23/23 nav links verified, XSS escaped, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Red Zone & Goal-Line as Phase 82**: Goal-line usage is one of the most discussed topics in fantasy football — "who's getting the carries inside the 5?" directly predicts TD upside. The two-section approach (Dominators = who gets the opportunities, TD Dependent = who needs TDs to produce) gives both actionable and cautionary insights. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("these RBs own the goal line" / "these players are TD-or-bust").
- **Goal-line (inside 5) vs red zone (inside 20)**: Used goal-line data (inside 5-yard line) from player_season_pbp rather than broader red zone data because it's more predictive of actual TD scoring and more actionable. The 5-yard line is where TDs happen.
- **TD% of fantasy as dependency metric**: Calculating what percentage of a player's fantasy points come from touchdowns reveals floor risk — a player with 55% TD dependency has a fragile fantasy floor that collapses in weeks without scores.
- **Color-coded badges**: GL TD% uses green/yellow/red (conversion efficiency), TD% uses red/orange/green (higher = riskier dependency). Different color semantics for different meanings.

## Previous Phase: Phase 81 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from phases 76-80 QA+UX audit resolved. usage.html `window` parameter shadow fixed (renamed to `trendWindow`). Analytics pageview tracking fixed on yoy/airyards/explorer (replaced nonexistent `trackPageview()` with inline fetch). app.js load order fixed in usage.html (moved before inline script). XSS in explorer.html tooltip escaped + formatted. Air yards column headers all have title tooltips (WOPR, RACR, aDOT, AY%, Regr explained). Explorer dot click opens in new tab, cursor changes to pointer on hover. Usage H1 renamed to "Usage Trends" to match nav. QB position badge CSS added to airyards.html. Explorer event listener leak fixed. Matchups legend swatch border 1px→2px. PNG export watermark added to yoy/airyards/explorer. Air yards subtitle clarifies "pass catchers (WR/RB/TE)". Explorer axis selects pre-populated with defaults. Usage Delta header has tooltip.

### Phase 81 Tasks

## Previous Phase: Phase 80 — Stat Explorer (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /explorer.html page shows an interactive scatter plot where users can select any two metrics for X and Y axes from dropdown menus (17 metrics: PPG, Targets/G, Rec/G, Rec Yards/G, Rush Yards/G, Carries/G, Air Yards/G, TDs, Age, Snap%, aDOT, Catch Rate, RACR, Target Share, Air Yards Share, WOPR, Games). Each dot is a player, color-coded by position (QB blue, RB teal, WR terracotta, TE purple). Hover tooltip shows player name, team, and both stat values. Click dot → player profile. Canvas-drawn scatter with axis labels, gridlines, nice tick values, and linear regression trendline (dashed terracotta). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Resize handler redraws on window resize. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Error state with retry button. /api/stat-explorer endpoint returns player data with any two requested stats. Min 4 games filter. Rate metrics (target_share, air_yards_share, wopr) enriched from player_week_metrics only when needed. "Explorer" nav link added to all 22 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations.

### Phase 80 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/stat-explorer endpoint | DONE | 17 metrics, per-game + rate metric enrichment, min 4 games |
| 2 | Scatter plot page | DONE | Canvas scatter, axis dropdowns, hover tooltip, trendline, click→profile |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 22 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 22/22 nav links verified, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Stat Explorer as Phase 80**: The ability to plot any two stats against each other is quintessentially research-lab. It lets users discover relationships that predefined dashboards don't surface — "who has high aDOT but low PPG?" or "targets/game vs RACR" to find efficiency outliers. Each scatter plot is a unique screenshot opportunity for r/DynastyFF.
- **Canvas-drawn scatter**: Canvas gives us full control over the visualization — dot sizes, hover detection, trendlines, gridlines. No charting library needed. Keeps the bundle size at zero (no additional dependencies).
- **17 metrics**: Covers all major fantasy-relevant stats from both the core player_week_stats table and the player_week_metrics rate table. Adding new metrics later just means adding to the EXPLORER_METRICS list.
- **Linear regression trendline**: Shows the overall relationship direction at a glance. Dashed terracotta to match the brand accent without overwhelming the data points.
- **On-demand rate metric enrichment**: Only queries player_week_metrics when the user selects a rate metric (target_share, air_yards_share, wopr). This avoids unnecessary DB work for core stat pairs.

## Previous Phase: Phase 79 — Air Yards Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /airyards.html page shows an air yards analytics dashboard for pass catchers (WR/RB/TE). Two sections: "Buy Low" (high air yards rank, underperforming in PPG — positive regression candidates) and "Sell High" (low air yards rank, overperforming in PPG — negative regression candidates). Each player row shows: position badge, headshot, name, team, Tgt/G, total air yards, AY/G, aDOT, AirYd%, WOPR, RACR, PPG, regression delta badge (green=buy low, red=sell high), GP, and Caveat annotations. Position filter tabs (All/WR/RB/TE — no QB). Season selector. Sortable column headers with sort state tracking per section. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Color legend for regression indicator. Error state with retry button. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/air-yards endpoint queries player_week_stats for receiving_air_yards + targets, enriches with air_yards_share/wopr/target_share from player_week_metrics, computes aDOT and RACR, ranks by air yards vs PPG, and splits into buy_low (delta >3) and sell_high (delta <-3). Min 4 games + 10 targets filter. "Air Yards" nav link added to all 21 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 79 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/air-yards endpoint | DONE | Air yards + rate metrics query, regression delta ranking, buy_low/sell_high split |
| 2 | Air Yards dashboard page | DONE | Two-section table (buy low/sell high), sortable columns, regression badges, responsive, PNG export |

| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 21/21 nav links verified, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Air Yards Dashboard as Phase 79**: Air yards are one of the most discussed advanced metrics in dynasty fantasy football. The gap between a player's air yards ranking and their PPG ranking is one of the most reliable regression indicators — a player with lots of air yards but low PPG is likely to improve (buy low), while a player with high PPG but low air yards is likely to regress (sell high). This is the kind of analysis that gets screenshotted and shared on r/DynastyFF ("these WRs are due for a breakout based on air yards").
- **Regression delta as primary signal**: Rather than just showing raw air yards leaderboards (which users can already see in the Lab screener), the unique value is the regression indicator — the delta between air yards rank and PPG rank. This surfaces actionable insight that raw stats don't.
- **No QB filter**: Air yards metrics for QBs (passing_air_yards) tell a different story than for receivers. This dashboard focuses specifically on pass catchers where air yards directly predict individual production. QBs have their own metrics (aDOT as a passer, CPOE, etc.).
- **Min 10 targets filter**: Combined with 4-game minimum, this prevents noise from players with tiny sample sizes who happen to have extreme aDOT or RACR values.

## Previous Phase: Phase 78 — Year-over-Year Comparison (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /yoy.html page shows year-over-year stat comparisons between two adjacent seasons. Two sections: "Risers" (players who improved most) and "Fallers" (players who declined most). Each player row shows: position badge, headshot, name, team, previous season value, current season value, delta arrow+value (green up / red down), mini-deltas for other key metrics, games played (prev→curr), and Caveat annotations. Metric selector to sort by different delta categories (PPG, Targets/G, Rec Yards/G, Rush Yards/G, Total TDs, Snap%). Season pair selector (e.g., "2024 vs 2023"). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Error state with retry button. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/year-over-year endpoint computes per-game stats for two adjacent seasons per player, calculates deltas, returns risers (delta > 0.5) and fallers (delta < -0.5) sorted by chosen metric. Min 4 games per season filter. "YoY" nav link added to all 20 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 78 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |

| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 20 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 20/20 nav links verified, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Year-over-Year as Phase 78**: "Who improved and who fell off?" is one of the most common dynasty trade evaluation questions. Year-over-year stat deltas contextualize whether a player is ascending or declining — critical for buy-low/sell-high decisions. Highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF ("biggest YoY risers heading into 2025").
- **Multi-metric selector**: Different metrics tell different stories. PPG delta is the headline, but target/game delta reveals opportunity changes, yard/game delta shows efficiency shifts, and snap% delta shows coaching trust. Letting users toggle between these creates multiple screenshot angles.
- **Mini-deltas for secondary metrics**: Showing all metric deltas in the same row (compactly) gives full context at a glance without needing to switch views. The primary metric is large, others are small inline chips.
- **Min 4 games filter**: Prevents small-sample noise. A player with 2 games inflated by one boom week shouldn't show as a "breakout year."

## Previous Phase: Phase 77 — Snap Count & Usage Trends (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /usage.html page shows snap count usage trends with Risers and Fallers sections. Table format with player rows showing headshot, name, position badge, team, current snap%, season average snap%, delta arrow+value (green up / red down), inline canvas sparkline bars showing weekly snap% history, games played, and Caveat annotations. Configurable window (3/5/8 weeks). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Click player row → player profile. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Error state with retry button. Responsive at 768px + 480px with hide-mobile columns. /api/usage-trends endpoint computes weekly snap% trends from offense_pct in player_week_stats, splits into risers (delta > 2%) and fallers (delta < -2%). "Usage" nav link added to all 19 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 19/19 nav links verified, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Snap Count Trends as Phase 77**: "Who's gaining/losing snaps?" is one of the most actionable pieces of fantasy intelligence. Rising snap counts are among the best predictive signals for future production. This dashboard surfaces the signal that power users manually track — highly screenshottable for r/DynastyFF.
- **Table format over cards**: Usage trends are inherently comparative — seeing 20-30 players' snap trajectories at once is more useful than individual cards. Tables compress better for screenshots.
- **Canvas sparklines**: Inline mini bar charts give instant visual read on the trend direction without needing a separate chart page. Color-coded (green=rising, red=falling) matches the delta arrows.
- **Window selector (3/5/8 weeks)**: Different time horizons matter — 3 weeks catches recent changes, 5 weeks is the default balanced view, 8 weeks shows sustained trends. All computed from the same data.
- **Delta threshold of 2%**: Filters out noise. Only shows players with meaningful snap% changes (>2% delta between first and second half of the window).

## Previous Phase: Phase 76 — Matchup Heatmap (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /matchups.html page shows a color-coded 32-team x 4-position heatmap grid of average fantasy points allowed per game (PPR). Green gradient = easy matchup (defense allows lots of points), red gradient = hard matchup (defense allows few points). 5-tier color scale using positional percentiles (p20/p40/p60/p80). Each cell shows avg PPG allowed and rank number. Caveat annotations ("cake", "soft", "tough", "avoid") on extreme matchups. Click cell in ALL mode → switches to position mode; in position mode → shows top 5 scorers detail panel with headshots. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Sortable column headers (team, per-position, total). PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Color legend. Responsive at 768px + 480px. /api/matchup-heatmap endpoint computes from opponent_team field in player_week_stats. "Matchups" nav link added to all 18 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry.

| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 18/18 nav links verified, design compliance confirmed |

### Decisions Log
- **Matchup Heatmap as Phase 76**: "Which defenses give up the most points?" is a fundamental fantasy question asked every single week. Matchup heatmaps are among the most screenshotted content on r/fantasyfootball during the season. Having this as a standalone dashboard adds a high-value tool that complements the existing analytics suite.
- **5-tier color scale**: Using positional percentiles (p20/p40/p60/p80) ensures the color coding is meaningful relative to each position. QB averaging 22 PPG allowed and RB averaging 14 PPG both appear "green" if they're top-quartile for their position.
- **Click-through detail**: In ALL mode, clicking a cell switches to position mode for that position. In position mode, clicking shows top 5 scorers against that defense — lets users understand WHY a defense is easy/hard.
- **Opponent_team field**: nflverse provides opponent_team on every player_week_stats row, so we can compute points allowed by simply summing fantasy_points_ppr grouped by opponent_team and position. No additional data needed.
- **Annotations**: "cake" (rank 1-3), "soft" (4-6), "tough" (bottom 6), "avoid" (bottom 3) — adds personality without cluttering the heatmap.

## Previous Phase: Phase 75 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from phases 71-75 QA+UX audit resolved. Canvas XSS pattern fixed (aging.html). Fetch resp.ok checks added (weekly+targets). app.js added (weekly+targets). Carries mode re-sort fixed (targets). Nav overflow handled with flex-wrap + mobile scroll. Weekly heatmap column sorting added. aria-labels on all tabs. "peak age" label fixed. Heat legend shows numeric thresholds. GP column added to weekly. try/except on 3 server endpoints. FANTASY_POSITIONS constant consistency. Retry buttons on error states. Aging subtitle clarifies curve vs dots data.

### Phase 75 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL + HIGH QA fixes | DONE | Canvas plain text, resp.ok, app.js, carries sort, name labels |
| 2 | HIGH UX fixes | DONE | Nav flex-wrap+scroll, heatmap column sorting |
| 3 | MEDIUM QA fixes | DONE | aria-labels, peak age, heat thresholds, try/except, FANTASY_POSITIONS |
| 4 | MEDIUM UX fixes | DONE | GP column, aging subtitle, retry buttons |
| 5 | Smoke test | DONE | All syntax valid, all fixes verified |

## Previous Phase: Phase 74 — Team Target Distribution (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /targets.html page shows team-by-team target and carry distribution as stacked horizontal bars (treemap-style). Each team card shows player segments sized by target/carry share, color-coded by position (QB blue, RB teal, WR terracotta, TE purple). Targets/Carries mode toggle. Player name labels on segments >8%. Player detail rows with position badge, name, count, share%. Team selector dropdown. Season selector. Caveat annotations ("owns this target tree", "spread it around"). Click player segment or row → player profile. PNG export with watermark. Position color legend. "Targets" nav link added to all 17 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry added. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 74 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/target-distribution endpoint | DONE | Per-team player targets/carries, shares, top 8 per team |
| 2 | Target distribution page with bars | DONE | Stacked bars, mode toggle, annotations, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 17 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 18/18 design checks, nav links verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Target Distribution as Phase 74**: "Where do the targets go?" is a fundamental dynasty question. Target distribution by team shows opportunity share at a glance — critical for evaluating landing spots pre-draft and identifying opportunity vacuums. Highly screenshottable.
- **Stacked horizontal bars**: Treemap-style bars make share distribution instantly visual. Position-colored segments let you see at a glance which positions dominate each team's passing game.
- **Targets/Carries mode toggle**: Both target distribution AND carry distribution matter. Separate modes let users switch context without cluttering one view.
- **Top 8 per team**: Prevents clutter from practice squad players with 1-2 targets. Shows the meaningful usage tree.
- **Caveat annotations**: "Owns this target tree" for dominant players (>30% share), "leads the way" (>22%), "spread it around" for balanced attacks. Adds the personality without cluttering.

## Previous Phase: Phase 73 — Weekly Scoring Heatmap (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /weekly.html page shows a color-coded grid of player weekly fantasy scores (rows = players, columns = weeks). Cells color-coded in 5 tiers from red (bad) to green (good) based on positional percentile thresholds. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Click player name → player profile. PNG export with watermark. Color legend (cold → hot). Bye weeks shown. Sticky player column. "Weekly" nav link added to all 16 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry added. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 73 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/weekly-heatmap endpoint | DONE | Per-week PPR scores, positional percentile thresholds, season/position/limit params |
| 2 | Weekly heatmap grid page | DONE | 5-tier color coding, sticky player col, bye weeks, hover highlight, responsive |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 16 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 18/18 design checks, nav links verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Weekly Scoring Heatmap as Phase 73**: Weekly scoring grids are among the most screenshotted fantasy content on r/DynastyFF and r/fantasyfootball. "Look at X's consistency" or "see how Y boomed Weeks 10-14" drives engagement. Table-based heatmap is more information-dense than charts and perfect for Reddit screenshots.
- **5-tier color scale**: Positional percentiles at p20/p40/p60/p80 create meaningful breaks. Red=bust, yellow=below avg, sand=average, light green=good, strong green=elite. Using positional thresholds means QB 18pts and RB 12pts both show as "good" relative to their position.
- **Sticky player column**: With 18 weeks of data, horizontal scroll is inevitable. Sticky player names ensure the heatmap stays readable.
- **Table over canvas**: Unlike aging curves, the heatmap is fundamentally tabular data. HTML tables give better accessibility, click targets, hover states, and responsive behavior than canvas.
- **Bye week display**: Showing "bye" in faint text instead of blank cells prevents confusion about missing data vs. zero-score weeks.

## Previous Phase: Phase 72 — Aging Curves Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /aging.html page shows position-specific aging curves (PPG by age) as canvas-drawn line charts with individual player dots plotted. Summary cards show peak age per position. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector. Click player dot → player profile. PNG export with watermark. Legend explaining curve vs dots. Canvas redraws on resize. "Aging" nav link added to all 15 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap entry added. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, Caveat annotations, position colors.

### Phase 72 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/aging-curves endpoint | DONE | Aggregate PPG-by-age curves + individual player dots, season/position params |
| 2 | Canvas aging curve charts | DONE | Filled area, curve line, player dots, peak marker, tooltips, click→profile |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 15 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 18/18 design checks, nav links verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Aging Curves as Phase 72**: Dynasty managers constantly debate when players peak and decline. Aging curve visualizations are among the most screenshotted content on r/DynastyFF. Making them interactive with real data and individual player dots makes them far more useful than static images.
- **Multi-season aggregate curve**: The curve averages PPG by age across ALL available seasons (2020+) for statistical robustness. Individual dots show the selected season only. This gives the curve real shape with enough sample size while showing current players.
- **Age adjustment**: Player ages in the DB are current age. For historical seasons, we subtract (latest_season - that_season) to estimate their age at the time. Not perfect (birthday timing) but close enough for curve shape.
- **Canvas rendering**: Canvas gives pixel-perfect control over the chart aesthetic — filled area under curve, dashed peak marker, semi-transparent dots — matching the comic-strip style better than any chart library.
- **Min 6 games filter**: Prevents small-sample noise from distorting the curve and individual dots.

## Previous Phase: Phase 71 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from phases 66-70 QA+UX audit resolved. Nav class fixed on scarcity/breakouts/buysell (main-nav → topnav with tiger logo). Connection leak fixed in fetch_prospect_scores (try/finally). XSS fixed: all numeric API values escaped in breakouts/buysell/scarcity innerHTML. Prospect click improved with position filter param. RBS/RPS tooltips added. Age badges standardized (young ≤24, prime 25-27, aging 28+). Scarcity summary labels improved (PPG units, ranked scarcity labels). Breakouts vs Buy/Sell subtitles clarified. Medium: LIMIT 500 on SQL queries, position validation on prospect-scores, aria-labels on season selects.

### Phase 71 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL + HIGH QA fixes | DONE | Nav class, connection leak, XSS escaping |
| 2 | Prospects click navigation | DONE | Added position filter, name-based search correct for combine data |

| 4 | MEDIUM fixes | DONE | LIMIT 500, position validation, aria-labels |
| 5 | Smoke test | DONE | All syntax valid, all fixes verified |

## Previous Phase: Phase 70 — Buy Low / Sell High Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /buysell.html page shows two columns: Buy Low candidates (high efficiency, low dynasty rank) and Sell High candidates (low efficiency, high dynasty rank). Each player rendered as a comic-strip card with position-colored top stripe, rank, headshot, name, position badge, team, age badge (young/prime/aging/veteran), efficiency grade badge (A+ to F, color-coded), value mismatch bar, Caveat annotation, and position-specific efficiency stats (QB: Y/A, TD%, INT%; RB: YPC, Y/TGT, TD%; WR/TE: Y/TGT, Catch%, YAC/R, TD%). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Click card → player profile. "Buy/Sell" nav link added to all 14 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap updated. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, hand annotations, position colors.

### Phase 70 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend buy-sell-candidates endpoint | DONE | GET /api/buy-sell-candidates, position-specific efficiency, dynasty value comparison, age amplifier |
| 2 | Buy/Sell page with two-column layout | DONE | Buy Low (green) / Sell High (red), efficiency grades, mismatch bars, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 14 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 16/16 design checks, XSS safe |

### Decisions Log
- **Buy Low / Sell High as Phase 70**: With dynasty trade season in full swing pre-draft, identifying value mismatches is core content for r/DynastyFF. "Buy low on X, sell high on Y" is the most common dynasty discussion format. Making these debates data-driven and screenshottable.
- **Efficiency vs dynasty rank percentile**: Comparing efficiency percentile (within position) against dynasty value rank percentile reveals true mismatches. A player can have elite efficiency but low dynasty value (buy) or high dynasty value but mediocre efficiency (sell).
- **Position-specific efficiency metrics**: QB uses Y/A + TD% - INT%. RB uses YPC + Y/TGT + TD%. WR/TE uses Y/TGT + Catch% + YAC/R + TD%. Each position's efficiency is measured by the stats that matter most for that role.
- **Age amplifier**: Young buy lows get a boost (more upside), old sell highs get a boost (more decline risk). Makes the signals dynasty-relevant, not just redraft.
- **10-point mismatch threshold**: Prevents marginal candidates from cluttering the lists. Only meaningful mismatches qualify.
- **Two-column layout**: Side-by-side Buy/Sell makes the page immediately scannable and highly screenshottable. Green up-arrow vs red down-arrow gives instant visual signal.

## Previous Phase: Phase 69 — Breakout Candidate Finder (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /breakouts.html page shows top breakout candidates ranked by Razzle Breakout Score (RBS) measuring the gap between opportunity metrics (snap%, target share, carries, air yards) and production (PPG). Each candidate rendered as a comic-strip card with position-colored top stripe, rank badge, headshot, name, position badge, team, age badge (young/prime/aging), RBS score, opportunity vs production horizontal bars, Caveat annotation, and key stats (PPG, snap%, position-specific usage, games). Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE). Season selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Click card → player profile. "Breakouts" nav link added to all 13 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap updated. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, hand annotations, position colors.

### Phase 69 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend breakout-candidates endpoint | DONE | GET /api/breakout-candidates, position-specific opportunity weighting, age bonus, RBS scoring |
| 2 | Breakouts page with candidate cards | DONE | Opportunity vs production bars, annotations, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 13 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 14/14 design checks, XSS safe |

### Decisions Log
- **Breakout Score algorithm**: Opportunity percentile (within position) minus production percentile, plus age bonus. Position-specific opportunity weights: QB uses snap% + attempts/game, RB uses snap% + carries/game + targets/game, WR/TE uses snap% + target_share + air_yards/game. Bigger gap = more breakout potential.
- **Age ≤27 cutoff**: Dynasty breakout candidates are young players who haven't peaked yet. 27 is the reasonable ceiling for "breakout" — older players with opportunity gaps are more likely declining, not breaking out.
- **6+ games minimum**: Ensures enough sample size. Filters out injured players and late-season additions who would create noise.
- **Visual: opportunity vs production bars**: Two horizontal bars make the "gap" immediately visible and screenshottable. Green for opportunity, gray for production — the space between them IS the story.

## Previous Phase: Phase 68 — Positional Scarcity Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /scarcity.html page shows PPG drop-off curves for each position (QB, RB, WR, TE) as bar charts with position-colored fills. Scarcity summary cards at top ranked by drop-off (most scarce to most replaceable). Each position card shows player bars from rank 1 to rank N with tier break dividers and Caveat annotations ("the starter line", "the RB cliff", "the TE premium cliff"). Season selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Click bar → player profile. "Scarcity" nav link added to all 12 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap updated. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, hand annotations, position colors.

### Phase 68 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend positional-scarcity endpoint | DONE | GET /api/positional-scarcity, PPG by position, tier breaks, scarcity scores |
| 2 | Scarcity page with drop-off charts | DONE | Bar charts, summary cards, tier breaks, responsive, PNG export |
| 3 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 12 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, 14/14 design checks, XSS safe |

### Decisions Log
- **Positional Scarcity as Phase 68**: With draft season approaching, showing PPG drop-off by position is core dynasty analytics content. "How scarce is TE?" and "Where's the RB cliff?" are questions r/DynastyFF debates constantly. This makes those debates screenshottable.
- **Bar charts over line charts**: Stepped bar charts with player names make it actionable — you can see exactly WHO is at each rank, not just a line. More information density, more screenshottable.
- **Summary cards ranked by drop-off**: Leading with "most scarce" to "most replaceable" gives the headline insight immediately. No need to compare charts manually.
- **Standard league thresholds**: QB1-12, RB1-24, WR1-36, TE1-12 maps to a 12-team league with standard roster construction. These are the thresholds dynasty players think in.

## Previous Phase: Phase 67 — Rookie Big Board (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /prospects.html page shows all prospects ranked by Razzle Prospect Score (RPS), grouped into 4 tiers (Elite 80+, Premium 60-79, Solid 40-59, Raw <40). Each prospect card shows rank, position badge (color-coded), name, school, draft round/pick chip, height/weight, and combine percentile mini-bars (40yd, Vert, Broad, Bench, 3Cone, Shuttle) with color-coded fills (green 80%+, blue 60%+, yellow 40%+, orange 20%+, red <20%). RPS score displayed prominently. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE) with segmented control. Draft year selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Click card → Lab prospect search. "Prospects" nav link added to all 11 HTML pages (nav + footer). Sitemap updated. Analytics tracking. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, display font headers, mono data, hand annotations, position colors.

### Phase 67 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Build prospects.html with tiered cards | DONE | RPS tiers, percentile bars, position filters, year selector, PNG export |
| 2 | Nav links + sitemap + analytics | DONE | All 11 pages updated, sitemap entry, pageview tracking |
| 3 | Smoke test | DONE | 14/14 design checks pass, JS syntax clean, nav verified |

### Decisions Log
- **RPS as primary ranking**: Razzle Prospect Score (athleticism 60% + draft capital 30% + size 10%) gives a data-driven composite that's unique to Razzle. More screenshottable than just listing combine numbers.
- **4 tiers not 8**: Unlike dynasty rankings (8 tiers), prospects only need 4 — the data is sparser and the tiers are more meaningful when fewer.
- **Percentile mini-bars**: Color-coded horizontal bars for each combine metric give an instant visual read on athletic profile. Green = elite, red = concern. Makes each card a mini scouting report.
- **Click → Lab search**: Rather than building a separate prospect profile page, clicking a card searches the Lab in prospect mode. Reuses existing infrastructure and drives users to the Lab.

## Previous Phase: Phase 66 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from phases 61-65 QA audit resolved. fantasy_relevant column added to DB migration. SQL injection pattern replaced with parameterized queries. Connection leak fixed with try/finally and single connection. trackPageview standardized to inline fetch. DVS label and methodology note added to rankings page. Medium fixes: 2px borders on team.html badges, age badge terminology standardized (young/prime/aging), "Full Profile" link in Lab overlay, contextual back navigation in player.js, rate stats hidden on leaders.html "All" view.

### Phase 66 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL: fantasy_relevant + SQL injection + connection leak | DONE | Migration added, parameterized queries, try/finally |
| 2 | HIGH: trackPageview analytics | DONE | Inline fetch on team.html and leaders.html |
| 3 | HIGH: Rankings DVS label | DONE | DVS suffix + methodology note in header |
| 4 | MEDIUM fixes | DONE | Borders, age badges, overlay link, back nav, rate stats |
| 5 | Smoke test | DONE | All 10 findings verified fixed, syntax clean |

## Previous Phase: Phase 65 — Team Roster Pages (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /team/{abbr} pages show full fantasy-relevant roster organized by position (QB, RB, WR, TE). Each position group rendered as a comic-strip card with position-colored header tint, display font title, Caveat annotation, and player rows. Player rows show rank, headshot/initials, name, age badge (green ≤25/yellow 26-28/red ≥29), and position-specific stats (PPG highlighted, yards, TDs, games) in mono font. Click player row → player profile. Team selector dropdown with all 32 NFL teams. Season selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Teams nav link added to all 10 HTML pages (nav + footer). Team name in player profile and Lab overlay links to /team/{abbr}. Sitemap includes all 32 team pages. OG tags dynamically set per team. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, position-colored light tint headers, Space Mono for data, display font for headers, Caveat for annotations.

### Phase 65 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend team roster endpoint | DONE | GET /api/team-roster, grouped by position, ABBREV_TO_TEAM mapping |
| 2 | Team page with position group cards | DONE | Responsive grid, headshots, age badges, position-specific stats |
| 3 | Nav links + team links + sitemap | DONE | All 10 pages updated, player.js + lab.js team links, 32 sitemap entries |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, design verified, XSS safe, route order correct |

### Decisions Log
- **Team selector default**: Defaults to first team alphabetically (ARI) if no team specified in URL. URL updates via history.replaceState when team changes.
- **Position-specific stats**: QB shows Pass Yds/Pass TD/Rush Yds, RB shows Rush Yds/Rush TD/Rec, WR/TE show Rec Yds/Rec TD/Rec. PPG highlighted in terracotta for all positions. Makes each group immediately useful for its context.
- **Team links from profiles**: Team name in player profile hero and Lab overlay is now a clickable link to /team/{abbr}. Creates natural navigation flow: Lab → player → team → other players on that team.
- **No position filter tabs**: Unlike Rankings/Leaders, team pages don't need position filters since they already organize by position group. Keeps it clean.

## Previous Phase: Phase 64 — Stat Leaders Dashboard (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /leaders.html page shows top 10 players in 10 key fantasy stat categories (PPG, Passing Yards, Passing TDs, Rushing Yards, Rushing TDs, Receiving Yards, Receiving TDs, Receptions, Target Share, Yards Per Carry). Each category rendered as a comic-strip card with category name (display font), Caveat annotation, and top 10 list. Gold/silver/bronze circular rank badges for top 3 with ink borders and offset shadows. Player rows show headshot/initials, name, position badge (color-coded), team, stat value in mono font. Click row → player profile. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE) with position-specific category filtering. Season selector dropdown. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Leaders nav link added to all 9 HTML pages. Sitemap updated. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, position colors, Space Mono for data, display font for headers, Caveat for annotations.

### Phase 64 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend stat leaders endpoint | DONE | GET /api/stat-leaders, 10 categories, position-specific filtering |
| 2 | Leaders page with category cards | DONE | Responsive grid, gold/silver/bronze badges, hover lift |
| 3 | Filters + season + PNG + nav | DONE | Segmented tabs, season dropdown, html2canvas export, all pages updated |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, design verified, XSS safe, sitemap updated |

### Decisions Log
- **10 categories**: PPG (all positions), then position-specific passing/rushing/receiving stats + target share + yards per carry. When filtering by position, only relevant categories shown (e.g., QB filter hides receiving stats).
- **Gold/silver/bronze badges**: Top 3 get circular badges with distinct colors (gold #ffc857, silver #c5c5d0, bronze #d97757/terracotta). Makes the top 3 visually pop — instant screenshotability.
- **Caveat annotations**: Each category gets a personality annotation ("slinging it", "red zone royalty", "efficiency kings") — adds the comic-strip character without cluttering data.
- **Separate from Rankings**: Rankings = dynasty trade value tiers. Leaders = raw stat performance. Different user intent, both screenshottable.

## Previous Phase: Phase 63 — Dynasty Rankings Board (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** /rankings.html page shows top 200 dynasty-relevant players ranked by dynasty value (0-100), grouped into 8 visual tiers (Tier 1: Elite through Tier 8: Deep Stash). Each player card shows position badge (color-coded), team, age badge (green/yellow/red), dynasty value score, and PPG. Position filter tabs (All/QB/RB/WR/TE) with chunky segmented control. PNG export via html2canvas with watermark. Rankings nav link added to all 8 HTML pages (nav + footer). Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg, chunky 3px borders, 4px offset shadows, rotated tier badge stickers, position colors, Space Mono for data, display font for headers, Caveat for annotations.

### Phase 63 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend dynasty-rankings endpoint | DONE | GET /api/dynasty-rankings, compute_trade_value + tier assignment |
| 2 | Rankings page with tiered cards | DONE | Responsive grid, headshots, age badges, hover lift |
| 3 | Position filters + PNG export + nav | DONE | Segmented tabs, html2canvas export, all pages updated |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Python + JS syntax clean, design verified, XSS safe |

### Decisions Log
- **Dedicated page vs Lab view**: Rankings is a different user intent than the Lab screener. The Lab is for exploring/filtering data. The Rankings Board is for seeing the dynasty landscape at a glance — who's in Tier 1, who's a deep stash. Different enough to warrant its own page.
- **8 tiers**: Tier 1 (90+) through Tier 8 (<30) gives granular separation. Labels (Elite, Star, Starter, Solid, Bench, Depth, Flier, Deep Stash) match dynasty community vernacular.
- **Age badges**: Green (≤25), yellow (26-28), red (≥29) — instant visual signal of dynasty window status. Dynasty players care deeply about age.
- **Top-4 tier colors**: Tiers 1-4 get colored badges (terracotta, blue, teal, purple — matching position colors for visual consistency). Lower tiers get neutral badges.

## Previous Phase: Phase 62 — Global Quick Search (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Ctrl+K / Cmd+K opens command palette from any page. Type-ahead search hits lightweight /api/players/quick-search endpoint (indexed search_name LIKE + latest season PPG). Results show player headshot/initials, position badge (color-coded), team, PPG in mono font. Arrow keys navigate, Enter opens player profile, Escape closes. Recently viewed players (max 8) stored in localStorage, shown when input empty. Debounced 300ms search. Works on all 7 pages via app.js injection. Design matches DESIGN.md: sand bg card, 3px ink borders, 4px offset shadow, Caveat annotation, "pulling film..." loading state.

### Phase 62 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend quick-search endpoint | DONE | GET /api/players/quick-search, indexed LIKE + PPG subquery |
| 2 | Command palette UI | DONE | Modal with backdrop blur, position badges, headshots |
| 3 | Keyboard nav + recently viewed | DONE | Ctrl+K, arrows, Enter, Esc, localStorage recents |
| 4 | Smoke test | DONE | Syntax clean, all pages include scripts, design verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Lightweight endpoint**: Created dedicated quick_search_players() instead of reusing heavy fetch_players(). Hits only players table + PPG subquery — no full stat aggregation. Much faster for type-ahead.
- **Recently viewed in palette**: When input is empty, shows last 8 viewed players. Makes the palette immediately useful even without typing — power users can jump between players they're analyzing.
- **All pages**: Palette injected via app.js which all 7 HTML pages include. One component, universal access.

## Previous Phase: Phase 61 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from QA+UX audit of phases 56-60 resolved. XSS patches: 6 unescaped player names + 1 error message in renderPlayerComps/loadPlayerComps wrapped with escapeHtml(). Boom/Bust: histogram legend added (green=boom, red=bust, position=normal), grade sticker labeled "Consistency", consistency score (0-100) added to stat cards. Roster Value: grade badge labeled "Roster Grade" with tooltip, status badge labeled "Window" with tooltip. Backend: negative limit guard on /comps, removed redundant import. Design: stat card borders fixed to 3px/4px per guide. Comp annotation updated to explain cosine similarity.

### Phase 61 Tasks

| 4 | Backend hardening | DONE | Limit validation, dead import removed |
| 5 | Medium fixes | DONE | 3px borders, consistency score, comp annotation |

## Previous Phase: Phase 60 — Boom/Bust Analyzer (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Users can analyze any player's weekly fantasy score distribution via "Boom/Bust" button in player profile. GET /api/players/{id}/boom-bust returns weekly scores, boom rate (% weeks above 1.5× position average), bust rate (% weeks below 0.5× position average), consistency score (inverse coefficient of variation, 0-100), median, floor (10th percentile), ceiling (90th percentile), position-specific thresholds, grade (A+ through F), and position consistency rank. Frontend renders grade badge (rotated sticker, color-coded), 6 stat cards (median, floor, ceiling, boom%, bust%, rank), canvas histogram with boom/bust threshold lines (green/red dashed), and floor-ceiling range bar. "Export Boom/Bust PNG" generates 800×700 canvas image with all visuals and watermark.

### Phase 60 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend boom/bust endpoint | DONE | GET /api/players/{id}/boom-bust, consistency score, grade, percentiles, position rank |
| 2 | Frontend boom/bust UI | DONE | Boom/Bust button, grade sticker, stat cards, loading state |
| 3 | Visual histogram + volatility chart | DONE | Canvas histogram with boom/bust thresholds, range bar |
| 4 | PNG export | DONE | 800×700 canvas PNG with all visuals, watermark |
| 5 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, all references verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Boom/bust thresholds**: 1.5× and 0.5× position average PPG. Position-specific because QB PPG is different from RB PPG. A WR "boom" and a QB "boom" have different absolute thresholds.
- **Consistency score**: Inverse coefficient of variation (100 - CV×100). Captures both low-variance (consistent) and high-mean (reliable) production. A player with stdev=3 and mean=15 scores higher than stdev=3 and mean=8.
- **13-tier grade scale**: A+ through F matches the Roster Value Calculator's grading system for consistency across features.
- **In profile overlay**: Like comps, boom/bust analysis lives inside the player profile overlay. Users stay in context.

## Previous Phase: Phase 59 — Player Comp Finder (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Users can find the top-5 most statistically similar NFL players via cosine similarity on position-specific per-game stat vectors. "Find Comps" button in player profile overlay triggers GET /api/players/{id}/comps. Results render as position-colored comp cards showing similarity % (color-coded: 95%+ green, 90%+ orange), headshot/initials, team, games, PPG, and top 3 matching stats. Mini radar chart overlays target vs top comp on key stats. Full stat comparison table shows target + top 3 comps. "Export Comps PNG" generates branded canvas image with comp cards, stat table, and watermark.

### Phase 59 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend similarity endpoint | DONE | GET /api/players/{id}/comps, cosine similarity, position-specific vectors |
| 2 | Frontend comp finder UI | DONE | Find Comps button, comp cards, similarity %, matching stats |
| 3 | Visual comp report | DONE | Radar overlay, stat comparison table, Caveat annotation |
| 4 | PNG export | DONE | Canvas PNG with comp cards, stat table, watermark |
| 5 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, all references verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Position-specific stat vectors**: QB uses passing stats (ypg, td/g, comp%, y/a) + rushing + PPG. RB uses rushing + receiving + PPG + td rate. WR/TE use receiving stats + catch rate + PPG + td rate. 8 stats per position ensures meaningful comparisons within position groups.
- **Cosine similarity over Euclidean**: Cosine similarity captures production profile shape regardless of volume magnitude (a young player with fewer games but similar per-game rates will match veteran profiles).
- **Min 4 games filter**: Prevents tiny-sample comps from noise. Balances catching emerging players vs statistical reliability.
- **Comp in profile overlay**: Adding comps inside the existing profile overlay (not a new page) keeps the flow tight — user views a player, clicks "Find Comps", sees results without leaving context.

## Previous Phase: Phase 58 — Roster Value Calculator + Team Card (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Users can build a dynasty roster via "My Roster" button in Lab toolbar. Search to add players (localStorage persistence). "Calculate Value" sends player IDs to POST /api/roster-value which returns trade values, positional breakdown, average age, letter grade (A+ through F), and competing status (competing/retooling/rebuilding). Visual report shows: grade badge (comic-strip rotated sticker), positional pie chart (QB/RB/WR/TE), age vs value scatter plot, and ranked player values table. "Export Team Card" generates branded PNG with all visuals, player table, and razzle.lol watermark.

### Phase 58 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend roster-value endpoint | DONE | POST /api/roster-value, grade A+ to F, competing status |
| 2 | Frontend My Roster panel | DONE | Search + add + remove, localStorage, grouped by position |
| 3 | Visual roster report | DONE | Pie chart, age scatter, grade badge, player values table |
| 4 | PNG export team card | DONE | Canvas PNG, watermark, pie + scatter + player table |
| 5 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Grading scale**: Based on total roster trade value with 12 thresholds (A+ = 600+, F = <70). Benchmarked against typical 12-team dynasty league where a good roster might have 10-15 players at 30-50 value each.
- **Competing status heuristic**: Uses combination of total value and average age. Young + valuable = competing. Old or low value = rebuilding. Everything else = retooling.
- **Reused trade value model**: Leverages existing fetch_trade_values() for individual player values, keeping the system consistent with Trade Analyzer.

## Previous Phase: Phase 57 — Draft Pick Trade Calculator (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Trade Analyzer now supports dynasty draft picks (2025-2027, rounds 1-4, picks 1-12) alongside players. Pick values follow exponential decay curve (1.01=88.0, 1.12=40.7, 2.01=38.0, 4.12=3.3) on same 0-100 scale as player values. Users can add picks via Year/Round/Pick dropdowns + "Add Pick" button on both trade sides. Visual pick value chart (canvas) shows full 48-pick decay curve with round-colored dots and selected-pick highlighting. Pick cards render with round-colored badges (Rd1=terracotta, Rd2=blue, Rd3=teal, Rd4=purple). PNG export handles picks. Comic-strip design throughout.

### Phase 57 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Pick value model + API | DONE | Exponential decay, GET /api/trade/pick-values, 48 picks |
| 2 | Frontend pick selector | DONE | Dropdowns + "Add Pick" on both sides, pick cards with round colors |
| 3 | Visual pick value chart | DONE | Canvas curve, 48 dots, round colors, selected highlighting |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Exponential decay model**: V = 88 * e^(-0.07 * (pick-1)). Calibrated so 1.01 ≈ top-5 dynasty asset (88), late 4th ≈ dart throw (3.3). Same 0-100 scale as player trade values for direct comparison.
- **Round colors match position colors**: Rd1=terracotta (WR), Rd2=blue (QB), Rd3=teal (RB), Rd4=purple (TE). Reuses existing design palette for consistency.
- **Multi-year support**: Year dropdown allows 2025-2027. Pick values are identical across years (no future discount) — simplest version that works for dynasty rookie drafts.

## Previous Phase: Phase 56 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from Phases 51-55 audit resolved. XSS patched in league-intel.html (15 escapeHtml/escapeAttr calls). FILTER_COLUMN_MAP SQL column names fixed (pass_attempts→attempts, total_tds→touchdowns). Heat coloring: tooltip explains percentile scale, button hidden in non-NFL modes. Sleeper players endpoint cached. Design guide border violations fixed (1px→2px). formatTimeAgo "just now" for recent entries.

### Phase 56 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | XSS patches | DONE | All Sleeper API data escaped in league-intel.html |
| 2 | FILTER_COLUMN_MAP fix | DONE | pass_attempts→attempts, total_tds→touchdowns |
| 3 | Heat coloring UX | DONE | Tooltip, hidden in non-NFL modes |
| 4 | MEDIUM fixes | DONE | Sleeper cache, borders, formatTimeAgo |
| 5 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

## Previous Phase: Phase 55 — Player Headshots in Lab Table (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Lab table displays 28px circular player headshots next to player names. nflverse headshot_url stored in players table and returned in all screener/profile API responses. Position-colored initials fallback for missing headshots (college/prospects). Headshots also in profile overlay (56px) and standalone player page (64px). Responsive (22px at 768px, hidden at 480px). Comic-strip aesthetic with chunky ink borders.

### Phase 55 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend headshot_url storage | DONE | Column added to players table, nflverse adapter stores during sync, migration for existing DBs |
| 2 | Backend API response | DONE | headshot_url in all 3 screener queries + all 3 profile queries |
| 3 | Frontend headshot rendering | DONE | playerHeadshot() helper, onerror fallback initials, all universes |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, lazy loading, responsive |

### Decisions Log
- **Headshot in all universes**: NFL players get real headshots from nflverse CDN. College/prospects get position-colored initials fallback (no headshot URLs in college data). Consistent visual treatment across all modes.
- **onerror fallback**: If headshot CDN fails, gracefully falls back to hidden img + visible initials span. No broken image icons.
- **Hidden at 480px**: On very small screens, headshots take too much horizontal space in the already-cramped player name cell. Hidden entirely below 480px.

## Previous Phase: Phase 54 — Lab Percentile Heat Coloring (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Lab table cells color-coded by positional percentile rank via "Heat" toggle button. Per-position percentile computation (frontend-only). Elite (90th+) green-tinted, poor (<10th) red-tinted, average neutral. Inverse stats (turnovers, fumbles, INTs, etc.) correctly inverted. Toggle persists in URL (heat=1) and localStorage. Keyboard shortcut H. Warm-shifted rgba colors match Anthropic sand palette.

### Phase 54 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Percentile calculation | DONE | Frontend-only, per-position, cached |
| 2 | Heat coloring UI | DONE | Toggle button, color scale, all universes |
| 3 | Polish & edge cases | DONE | Inverse stats, URL/localStorage, shortcut H |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Frontend-only percentiles**: Chose client-side computation over backend endpoint. Data already loaded in state.items. No API changes, no additional DB queries. Percentiles are relative to current view/filters which is more useful.
- **Per-position percentiles**: A WR with 800 receiving yards is elite among WRs but that shouldn't be compared to QBs. Each position group gets its own distribution.
- **Warm-shifted rgba**: Used rgba() with low opacity to tint cells rather than solid backgrounds, keeping the Anthropic sand aesthetic. Green = teal-shifted (#2ec4b6), Red = warm (#e63946).

## Previous Phase: Phase 53 — Reddit Launch Prep (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Featured card "Open in Lab" links enhanced with rich preset URLs (dynasty_value sort, receiving columns, min_gp filters). All preset URL system verified working. Reddit title generator comprehensive.

### Phase 53 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Enhanced featured card links | DONE | Rich Lab URLs |
| 2 | Preset URL verification | DONE | All params work |
| 3 | Reddit title generator | DONE | Already good |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

## Previous Phase: Phase 52 — War Room Agent Memory (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** War Room persists briefing history (max 20 entries) in localStorage. Memory button toggles history panel. Keyword-scored relevance matching injects top 3 past briefings as "WHAT THE WAR ROOM REMEMBERS" into agent prompts. Clear memory option available.

### Phase 52 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Briefing history storage | DONE | localStorage, max 20, key findings extracted |
| 2 | History panel UI | DONE | Toggle, timestamps, clear memory |
| 3 | Memory injection | DONE | Keyword relevance scoring, top 3 |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

## Previous Phase: Phase 51 — League Intel Manager Profiles (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** League Intel page now has "Scout Rival Managers" button that fetches Sleeper transaction history (weeks 1-18) and generates behavioral profiles for rival managers. Each profile shows: manager name, record, behavioral summary (e.g., "active trader, stockpiles WRs, FAAB whale"), trade count, waiver count, FAAB spent, total moves. Profiles saved to localStorage for War Room context bridge. Comic-strip card design, mobile responsive.

### Phase 51 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Fetch Sleeper transactions | DONE | Parallel fetch weeks 1-18 |
| 2 | Behavioral analysis engine | DONE | Traits: trade tendency, position bias, FAAB, activity |
| 3 | Manager profile cards UI | DONE | 2-col grid, color stripes, context bridge |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Client-side analysis**: Transaction data fetched from Sleeper API directly in browser. No backend needed.
- **18-week parallel fetch**: All weeks in parallel for ~500ms total.

## Previous Phase: Phase 50 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from Phases 46-49 audit fixed. XSS in OG tags patched (html.escape on all 3 handlers). Stored XSS in formula review text patched (escapeHtml). User enumeration fixed (generic login error). Rate limiter memory bounded (10k IP cap). Shuffle button visibility improved (yellow on dark bg). Accessibility improved (aria-live on demo cards). Position values escaped in featured cards.

### Phase 50 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | CRITICAL: OG tag XSS | DONE | _html.escape on lab, player, compare handlers |
| 2 | CRITICAL: Formula review XSS | DONE | escapeHtml(existingUserReview.text) |
| 3 | HIGH: Login user enumeration | DONE | Generic "Invalid email or password" for both cases |
| 4 | HIGH: Rate limiter memory | DONE | _RATE_MAX_IPS=10000, stale pruning |
| 5 | HIGH: Shuffle button + a11y | DONE | Yellow text/border, aria-live="polite" |
| 6 | MEDIUM: Position escaping | DONE | escapeHtml(p.position) in featured cards |
| 7 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

## Previous Phase: Phase 49 — Performance Audit + Optimization (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Added composite SQLite index idx_pws_season_player(season, player_id) for the most common screener query pattern. Added GZipMiddleware for all JSON responses (min 500 bytes). Added Cache-Control headers (5 min) on /api/featured and /api/filter-options. Added in-memory Python cache (5-min TTL) for filter_options and featured queries. Audited all enrichment functions — all batch by player_id (no N+1 queries). Frontend table rendering already optimized (single innerHTML assignment, debounced search, reusable canvas).

### Phase 49 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend index + query audit | DONE | Composite index on season,player_id. No N+1 queries. |
| 2 | Frontend render audit | DONE | Already optimized — innerHTML batch, debounced search, reusable canvas |
| 3 | API caching + gzip | DONE | GZipMiddleware, Cache-Control 300s, in-memory Python cache |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Season-first composite index**: The main screener query filters by season then joins on player_id. Existing index was (player_id, season, week) — great for per-player lookups but forces full index scan when filtering by season. New (season, player_id) index covers the common query path.
- **In-memory cache over Redis**: Simple dict-based cache with TTL. No external dependency. Resets on restart, but data only changes on adapter sync. Sufficient for current scale.
- **GZip at 500 bytes**: Screener JSON responses are typically 50-200KB. GZip reduces this 5-10x. Minimal CPU overhead.

## Previous Phase: Phase 48 — Agent Bio Cards + War Room Demo (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All features already existed from prior work. Home page has "Meet the Team" section with 6 agent bio cards (pixel avatar, name, role, specialty) in comic-strip card style with color stripes and stagger rotation. War Room demo section shows 3 randomized anonymized briefing snippets with urgency badges and redacted league data, plus shuffle button. Agent bio cards also on agents.html hero section via warroom.js. Mobile responsive at 768px and 480px. All syntax verified clean.

### Phase 48 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Agent bio data | DONE | AGENT_BIOS in index.html, matching data in warroom.js |
| 2 | Bio cards on home + agents page | DONE | renderAgentBios() + warroomBioGrid |
| 3 | War Room demo on home page | DONE | 20+ demoBriefings, renderDemoCards(), shuffle |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Already built**: Phase 48 features were implemented in earlier phases. Verified present and working rather than rebuilding.

## Previous Phase: Phase 47 — Home Page Live Data Widgets (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Home page shows 3 live data widgets — Dynasty Risers (PPG/age ratio), Rookie Big Board (prospect scores), Breakout Candidates (high target share + low PPG). Each card shows 5 players with position badges, key stats, and "Open in Lab" links with pre-applied filters. Styled in comic-strip design (3px borders, 4px shadows, sand bg). Mobile responsive (cards stack at 768px). Fade-in animation. Loading state: "pulling film...". Graceful error handling.

### Phase 47 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend /api/featured endpoint | DONE | fetch_featured() in live_data.py — 3 SQL queries for dynasty_risers, rookie_board, breakout_candidates |
| 2 | Frontend featured cards | DONE | 3 cards below hero, position badges, key stats, "Open in Lab" links |
| 3 | Mobile responsive + animation | DONE | Stack at 768px, fade-in, loading/error states |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, JS + Python verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Featured data source**: Used existing terminal.db tables — player_season_stats for dynasty risers and breakout candidates, big_board for rookie prospects. No new data sources needed.
- **Lab link format**: Each card links to Lab with pre-applied universe, sort, and filter params via URL query string. Users land in the Lab with context already set.
- **Graceful degradation**: Featured section hidden entirely if API fetch fails. No broken UI for first-time visitors.

## Previous Phase: Phase 46 — QA + UX Audit Fixes (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All critical and high findings from Phases 41-45 QA+UX audit fixed. Formula store XSS patched (escapeHtml on name/creator/description). War Room API key notice shown upfront with disabled Run button until key set. Lab first-visit toast guides new users to presets. Auth rate limiting (10/min/IP) on login/register. Generic error messages in auth.py. Home page "Coming Soon" updated. Prospect/college zero values show "—" instead of 0. Draft year range validated.

### Phase 46 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Formula store XSS fix | DONE | escapeHtml on name, creator, description |
| 2 | War Room API key messaging | DONE | Notice div, disabled Run button, updateApiKeyNotice() |
| 3 | Lab first-visit preset toast | DONE | razzle_lab_visited flag, PPR preset hint, 6s auto-dismiss |
| 4 | Rate limiting + error messages + copy | DONE | 10/min/IP, generic errors, "The War Room" |
| 5 | MEDIUM fixes — zeros, draft year | DONE | Prospect/college dash for 0, draft_year range validation |
| 6 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean |

### Decisions Log
- **In-memory rate limiter**: Simple defaultdict-based rate limiter. No external dependency. Resets on restart, but sufficient for current scale. Replace with Redis-backed limiter when needed.
- **First-visit toast not modal**: Chose a dismissible toast over a modal overlay. Modals block the user; toasts inform without friction. Matches the "trust the user" design principle.
- **Prospect zero suppression**: All 0/null/undefined values in prospect and college mode show "—". This is aggressive but correct — prospects without NFL stats shouldn't show 0.

## Previous Phase: Phase 45 — War Room Pro Gating — Free vs Paid Context (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** War Room league context injection gated to Pro subscribers only. `isLeagueContextMode()` now requires `isProUser()` (user.plan === "pro") AND `hasLeagueData()`. Free users with Sleeper connected see "League Context — Pro Only" locked badge, forced into generic mode. Pro users get full league context injected into agent prompts. Post-scenario teaser card for free users: "your league data is connected but locked" with Upgrade CTA. Briefing cards show "Pro" pill when league context active, or generic mode hint for free users. CSS for locked badges, pro pill, generic hint, and teaser card all follow design system.

### Phase 45 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Gate league context to Pro subscribers | DONE | isProUser(), hasLeagueData(), isLeagueContextMode() gated, buildUserMessage() gated |
| 2 | Paywall UX — locked badges, CTA, teaser | DONE | Locked badge, Pro Only label, post-run teaser card with checkout CTA |
| 3 | Pro indicator on response cards | DONE | Pro pill badge, generic hint text on briefing cards |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, gating logic verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Client-side gating**: League context gating is enforced in the browser JS. Since LLM calls are browser-side (user's own API key), server-side enforcement isn't needed yet. Future: when Razzle hosts LLM calls for Pro users, server-side gating will be added.
- **Three-state badge**: Mode badge now has three states: "League Context — Pro" (active/green), "League Context — Pro Only" (locked/orange), "Generic Mode" (inactive/gray). Clear visual hierarchy for the conversion funnel.
- **Post-scenario teaser**: Only shown when user has league data but isn't Pro. Doesn't show for users without Sleeper connected (they see the existing upsell zone instead). Avoids double-prompting.

## Previous Phase: Phase 44 — Brand Voice — Watermark, Copy, Personality Pass (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** All watermarks updated to "razzle.lol — let's razzle dazzle em baby". Zero instances of "built different" remain. All UI copy matches brand identity — film room energy, peer tone, no corporate language. Loading states use "pulling film...", "checking the tape...", "running the numbers...". Error states use "fumble" language. 404 page: "This page got cut from the roster." 28 column tooltips rewritten in warm, peer-like brand voice. Home page hero subtitle updated. War Room upsell copy on-brand. Export PNGs carry new watermark.

### Phase 44 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Update all watermarks to new tagline | DONE | 12 canvas in lab.js, 3 in charts.js, 5 HTML footers, 2 SVG OG images, meta desc, DESIGN.md |
| 2 | Brand voice pass on all UI copy | DONE | 404, error messages, War Room upsell, home hero, formula store errors |
| 3 | Tooltip voice pass | DONE | 28 tooltips rewritten — WOPR, RACR, DAKOTA, DVS, aDOT, YPRR, CPOE etc. |
| 4 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, zero "built different", brand voice consistent |

### Decisions Log
- **Watermark tagline**: "razzle.lol — let's razzle dazzle em baby" per DESIGN.md brand voice section.
- **Tooltip tone**: Warm, slightly opinionated, peer-like. One sentence max. No clinical definitions.
- **Error language**: "fumble" metaphor for failures, consistent with football film room voice.

## Previous Phase: Phase 43 — Stripe Integration — Subscriptions and Payment (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Stripe integration complete. Backend: POST /api/billing/create-checkout (yearly/monthly), POST /api/billing/webhook (signature verified, handles checkout completed/subscription deleted/payment failed), GET /api/billing/status (plan + portal URL). Subscriptions table in users.db. Frontend: plan badge in nav (Free/Pro), Manage Subscription link for pro users, War Room upsell calls startCheckout(), pricing section on home page ($240/year + $20/month). All keys from env vars. stripe>=7.0.0 added to requirements.txt.

### Phase 43 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend Stripe endpoints + webhook | DONE | billing.py, 3 endpoints, webhook handler |
| 2 | Frontend upgrade flow + billing UI | DONE | Plan badge, Manage link, pricing section, checkout integration |
| 3 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, billing flow verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Env var config for all Stripe keys**: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY, STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY all from environment. Graceful fallback (503) when not set.
- **Subscriptions table in users.db**: Keeps billing data with user data, separate from terminal.db stats.
- **Plan badge in nav**: Simple visual indicator — gray "Free" or terracotta "Pro" badge next to username.

## Previous Phase: Phase 42 — Auth System — Registration, Login, JWT, Protected Endpoints (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Users can register with email/password, log in, receive JWT token, and access protected endpoints. bcrypt hashing (12 rounds), JWT 7-day expiry, JWT_SECRET from env var. Frontend auth modal on all pages with Sign In/Register tabs, token in localStorage, auto-included Authorization headers. Sleeper username linkable to account with post-login prompt. Formula publish requires auth. War Room upsell is auth-aware. User formulas sync to server database. users.db separate from terminal.db.

### Phase 42 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Backend auth endpoints + user table | DONE | auth.py + users.db, bcrypt, JWT, 4 endpoints |
| 2 | Frontend login/register modal | DONE | Injected via app.js on all pages, Razzle design system |
| 3 | Link Sleeper username | DONE | Post-login prompt, nav display, League Intel auto-connect |
| 4 | Protect endpoints + plan gating | DONE | require_plan(), formula publish auth, War Room auth-aware CTA |
| 5 | Migrate formulas to database | DONE | CRUD endpoints, server sync, auto-import on login |
| 6 | Persistent users.db | DONE | Separate from terminal.db, created on startup |
| 7 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, full auth flow verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Auth UI via JS injection**: Added auth functions to app.js, which injects Sign In button and modal into any page with a .topnav .nav-links. No per-page HTML changes needed for the auth UI itself.
- **Error dict pattern**: auth.py returns error dicts instead of raising HTTPException, server.py checks for "error" key and converts to JSONResponse. Simpler testing.
- **Sleeper prompt after login**: Shows Sleeper connect form in the auth modal after login/register if no sleeper_username linked. Skippable.
- **Formula sync alongside localStorage**: Rather than replacing localStorage, server sync runs in parallel. Non-logged-in users keep using localStorage. Logged-in users get both (localStorage for instant load, server for cross-device).

## Previous Phase: Phase 41 — Stats Expansion — Play-by-Play Extractions (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Play-by-play data extracted from nflverse pbp CSVs via new sync_pbp_data() function. Single-pass extraction populates player_season_pbp table. Stats available: pass/rush success rate, scramble stats, garbage time %, game script, goal-line carries/targets/TDs, two-point conversions, return yards/TDs, intended air yards per target, drop rate, bye week, games missed. 18 new columns wired into Lab screener with tooltips and updated presets. RYOE columns in schema but NULL (nflverse pbp lacks expected rushing yards). Play-action stats NULL (nflverse 2024 lacks is_play_action column).

### Phase 41 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Success rate + RYOE + game script | DONE | Pass/rush success rate via EPA>0, game script via avg score_differential |
| 2 | Play-action + scramble + garbage time | DONE | Scramble via qb_scramble on run plays, garbage time computed |
| 3 | Goal-line + 2PT + returns | DONE | GL inside 5-yard line, 2PT via two_point_conv_result, returns from kickoff/punt |
| 4 | Intended air yards + drop rate | DONE | IAY on all targets, drops estimated via incomplete short-medium passes |
| 5 | Bye week + injury data | DONE | Bye from schedule gaps, injury from nflverse injury designations |
| 6 | Wire as Lab screener columns | DONE | 18 new COLUMNS with tooltips, presets updated |
| 7 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, values verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Single-pass pbp extraction**: All Tasks 1-4 share one pbp CSV download, extracting all stats in parallel. Much faster than 4 separate passes.
- **Scrambles are run plays**: nflverse 2024 classifies scrambles as play_type=run with qb_scramble=1. Code handles both locations.
- **Play-action unavailable**: nflverse 2024 pbp lacks is_play_action column. Desc-field fallback also returns nothing. Columns in schema but NULL.
- **RYOE unavailable**: nflverse pbp has xyac for receiving but no expected rushing yards. Columns in schema but NULL.
- **Drop rate is estimated**: Uses incomplete short-medium passes (air_yards<15, non-INT) as proxy since nflverse doesn't have a clean drop flag.

## Previous Phase: Phase 40 — Stats Expansion — Computed Columns (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** 11 new computed stat columns in the Lab screener, all derived from existing database fields with no adapter changes. Passer rating (NFL formula), AY/A, TD rate, fumble rate, dominator rating (WR/TE), rush share (RB/QB), YPRR* approximation, WOPR/G, PPFD, PPFD/G, plus custom scoring builder with up to 3 named configs. Red zone share skipped (no play-by-play data yet). PPFD ready but first_downs data not yet in DB.

### Phase 40 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Passer rating + AY/A + TD rate + fumble rate | DONE | NFL formula with clamped components, all in _enrich_with_derived_stats() |
| 2 | Dominator rating + rush share | DONE | Team-share query via _enrich_with_team_shares(), position-filtered |
| 3 | YPRR* + WOPR/G | DONE | YPRR via snap-based route estimation, WOPR/G in _enrich_with_epa_per_play() |
| 4 | PPFD + superflex tooltip | DONE | PPR + 1pt per first down, PPR tooltip updated |
| 5 | Custom scoring builder | DONE | Modal with 12 weight inputs, localStorage, up to 3 configs |
| 6 | Deploy + smoke test | DONE | All syntax clean, values verified |

### Decisions Log
- **Red zone share skipped**: No rz_ columns in player_week_stats. Would require play-by-play extraction (Ticket 3).
- **WOPR/G placement**: Must run after _enrich_with_rate_metrics() populates wopr field, so placed in _enrich_with_epa_per_play().
- **YPRR estimation**: Uses offense_snaps * 0.85 for route participation estimate. Falls back to games * 45 * 0.85 if no snap data.
- **Custom scoring approach**: Client-side computation from raw stat values, not server-side. Allows instant recalculation without API calls.

## Previous Phase: Phase 39 — Shareable Player Comparison Pages (COMPLETE)

**Exit criterion MET:** Standalone /compare/{id1}/{id2} URL renders side-by-side player cards with stat differentials, overlaid radar chart, career arc comparison, and dynamic OG meta tags for rich Reddit/Discord previews. PNG export (1200x630) with watermark. Compare button on player profile pages with search overlay. Mobile responsive at 768px and 480px. All syntax clean.

### Phase 39 Tasks

| # | Task | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Build compare.html + compare.js | DONE | Side-by-side heroes, stat diff table, radar overlay, career arc, PNG export |
| 2 | Server route + OG tags + profile compare button | DONE | /compare/{id1}/{id2} with dynamic OG, player profile "Compare" button |
| 3 | Syntax check + smoke test | DONE | All 8 JS files + Python modules clean |

### Decisions Log
- **Compare via profiles, not Lab rows**: Chose to add Compare button to player profile pages rather than cluttering the dense Lab screener table. Users click a player name → see profile → hit Compare → search for second player. Clean flow, doesn't bloat the screener UI.
- **Same-position color differentiation**: When comparing two players of the same position, the second player gets a darker shade of the position color to maintain visual distinction in radar overlay and stat table.

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-08 | Name: Razzle | One word, football DNA (razzle-dazzle), domain available, comic-strip energy |
| 2026-03-08 | Domain: razzle.lol | Cheap, memorable, fits playful brand |
| 2026-03-08 | Orange → terracotta #d97757 | Claude-esque warmth, matches tiger mascot |
| 2026-03-08 | Fresh repo, not refactor | Every line intentional, no legacy baggage |
| 2026-03-08 | Render for hosting | Already known, free tier works, zero learning curve |
| 2026-03-08 | Garfield/Luckiest Guy font | Comic-strip chunky, stands out from every AI dashboard |
| 2026-03-08 | Agents will be NFL team animals | User picks teams they like, TBD |
| 2026-03-08 | Two-table data model | player_week_stats (fixed columns) + player_week_metrics (dynamic key-value) — proven pattern from FDL |
| 2026-03-08 | Skip half_ppr in nflverse | nflverse CSVs only have ppr and standard — half_ppr computed later if needed |
| 2026-03-08 | Single FastAPI serves frontend + API | No separate static site — simpler deploy, one Render service |
| 2026-03-08 | Defer NCAA toggle to Phase 1b/2 | Need college_adapter.py first, core NFL screener is the priority |
| 2026-03-08 | Defer week-level breakdowns | Season aggregates first, per-week view adds complexity — ship the table |
| 2026-03-08 | 5 column presets over custom | PPR/Passing/Rushing/Receiving/Dynasty covers 95% of use cases |
| 2026-03-08 | Canvas API over Chart.js | Zero dependencies, full control, smaller bundle, charts are simple enough |
| 2026-03-08 | Max 5 players for compare | Keeps radar readable, prevents API abuse |
| 2026-03-08 | Formulas as weighted composites | Simple percentage weights × stat values — covers dynasty values, efficiency scores, custom rankings |
| 2026-03-08 | Waitlist in localStorage | No backend auth yet, email capture is just localStorage. Real backend waitlist post-draft |
| 2026-03-08 | Sleeper players API cached client-side | The /players/nfl endpoint is 25MB+ — should be cached/proxied server-side in production |
| 2026-03-08 | 3 War Room demo cards | Razzle/Scout/Diplomat covers the breadth of agent types without over-promising |
| 2026-03-08 | nflverse combine + draft picks over CFBD API | Free CSVs, no API key needed, same adapter pattern as NFL data. Combine metrics + draft capital are the highest-value data for draft week dynasty users |
| 2026-03-08 | "Prospects" not "College" | Available data is combine/draft focused, not full college production stats. "Prospects" better describes what we have and what dynasty users want during draft week |
| 2026-03-08 | Blue accent for prospect mode | Per design guide — NFL/NCAA toggle uses blue (#5b7fff) for college/prospect content. Visual differentiation makes the toggle obvious |
| 2026-03-08 | Filters hidden in prospect mode | Prospect dataset is small (~300/year), position + sort + search covers all use cases. Will add filters if needed later |
| 2026-03-08 | 33 demo briefings not 50-60 | North Star says 50-60, but 33 across 6 agent types with 3 shown per visit = 5456 unique combinations. Diminishing returns past ~30. Can add more later |
| 2026-03-08 | SVG favicon over PNG | Zero-dependency, scales to any size, tiger emoji matches brand, no design tool needed |
| 2026-03-08 | Pre-launch polish before Phase 5 | All code phases done. Polish (mobile, demo rotation, design audit) maximizes Reddit launch impact |
| 2026-03-08 | Multi-season data (2020-2024) | Single-season severely limits dynasty analysis. 5 seasons enables career arcs, breakout detection, year-over-year trends. Essential for Reddit draft-week content |
| 2026-03-08 | Career view as first dropdown option | Dynasty managers think in careers, not single seasons. Career aggregates are the default mental model for dynasty analysis |
| 2026-03-08 | Advanced metrics from player_week_metrics | target_share, WOPR, RACR, EPA are Reddit power user stats. Enriched via secondary query (not JOIN) to keep main query fast |
| 2026-03-08 | Python re-sort for derived metrics | Derived/rate metrics can't be sorted in SQL since they're computed post-query. Fetch extra rows, re-sort in Python. Trade-off: slightly less precise pagination but much simpler architecture |
| 2026-03-09 | Player profiles as Phase 10 | All 9 roadmap phases complete. Player profile modals are the most impactful next feature for Reddit screenshots — clicking a player name shows a rich detail view. CFBD college data deferred (needs API key). Profile export creates another shareable asset. |
| 2026-03-09 | Position-specific profile layouts | QB/RB/WR/TE each get different headline stats and season table columns. QBs see pass yards/TDs/CMP%, RBs see rush/rec, WR/TE see targets/receptions/YAC. More useful than one-size-fits-all. |
| 2026-03-09 | Heat maps + breakout detection as Phase 11 | Heat maps fill the last major visualization gap from the North Star. Positional percentile heat maps are extremely screenshottable for Reddit — dynasty managers love position tier grids. Breakout detection (50%+ YoY PPR) leverages multi-season data for a uniquely useful dynasty signal. Both create new shareable content types. |
| 2026-03-09 | Prospect cards as Phase 12 | Clickable prospect profiles with athletic percentile bars and spider charts are THE draft week content for r/DynastyFF and r/NFL_Draft. Combine percentiles within position group give instant context (is 4.50 fast for a WR?). Spider charts create a unique visual fingerprint per prospect — highly screenshottable. Uses existing nflverse combine data, no CFBD API key needed. |
| 2026-03-09 | Athletic comps + tier view as Phase 13 | "Who is this prospect's NFL athletic comp?" is THE question dynasty managers ask during draft week. Euclidean distance on percentile-normalized combine metrics finds historical matches. Tier view groups a whole position's draft class by athletic profile — creates screenshottable tier lists for Reddit. Prospect comparison mode enables side-by-side analysis. All three features use existing nflverse data, creating maximum content from available data. |
| 2026-03-09 | Composite prospect scoring as Phase 14 | Razzle Prospect Score (RPS) creates a single "how good is this prospect" number combining athletic percentile (60%), draft capital (30%), and size (10%). Big Board ranked list is THE draft-week content for dynasty Reddit — "Razzle's 2025 WR Big Board" with tier bands is an instant screenshottable PNG. CFBD college production stats blocked (no API key), so RPS maximizes value from available combine+draft data. |
| 2026-03-09 | Unified prospect report cards as Phase 15 | Prospect profile cards were missing RPS score and comp-based projections — data was spread across Big Board and profile. Consolidating everything (RPS + tier badge + percentile bars + spider chart + comps + projections) into one view creates THE definitive shareable prospect card for Reddit. One click, one card, one PNG. Client-side RPS computation avoids extra API call. Comp-based projections use weighted similarity averages of comp NFL careers. |
| 2026-03-09 | Draft class analytics as Phase 16 | Cross-year class comparison creates a new category of screenshottable content: "Is the 2025 WR class better than 2024?" posts get massive engagement on r/DynastyFF during draft season. Reuses existing RPS computation across all draft years (2020-2026). Class grades (A/B/C/D) based on avg RPS + elite/premium ratio create instant talking points. Bar chart + class cards = two shareable formats from one feature. No new external dependencies. |
| 2026-03-09 | College production stats as Phase 17 | cfbfastR play-level CSV aggregation unlocks "which WR dominated in college?" content for Reddit. sportsdataverse GitHub CSVs = free, no API key, same pattern as nflverse. Three-way universe toggle (NFL/Prospects/College) keeps the Lab as the single power tool. College profiles cross-reference combine/draft data for prospect pipeline analysis. |
| 2026-03-09 | Dynasty Value Score as Phase 19 | Dynasty rankings are THE most shared content on r/DynastyFF. Every tool has them, Razzle didn't. DVS = age-adjusted PPR composite with position-specific curves (QBs age slowly, RBs drop fast). nflverse roster CSVs provide free age data (birth_date). "Dynasty Rankings" preset creates instant shareable content: "Razzle's Top 200 Dynasty Rankings." Simple formula, huge screenshotability. |
| 2026-03-11 | Multi-season Sleeper history as Phase 135 | Multi-season league history crawling via previous_league_id chain is essential for the Historian agent and behavioral profiling. Paid users get up to 5 seasons of transaction data aggregated into enhanced manager profiles with panic indicators, positional bias consistency, win/loss correlation, FAAB trends, and per-season breakdowns. This data feeds directly into agent prompts via the context bridge, creating the "ChatGPT can't do this" moat for league-contextualized answers. Free users get single-season only, making the upgrade gap visceral. |
| 2026-03-11 | Agent memory engine as Phase 136 | Server-side agent memory is the highest-impact Elite differentiator. localStorage memory (20 entries) works for all users. Elite gets cloud-synced memory (100 entries) with league_id tagging, keyword search, and time-decay relevance scoring. This creates massive switching cost — the longer you use Razzle, the smarter your agents get. Memory panel shows cloud-sync status with badges. buildUserMessage injects memory with league context so agents say "last time you asked about [Player] in [League], we recommended..." |
| 2026-03-11 | Landing page conversion polish as Phase 137 | Auto-rotating demo briefings create the illusion of a live War Room — agents are visibly "working" with 8-second rotation and smooth fade transitions. Personalized CTA adapts to user state: paid users see "Enter the Situation Room," free users with Sleeper see their actual player name in the CTA, unconnected users get "Connect Sleeper." Feature comparison table on agents.html pricing section makes the Free/Pro/Elite gap visceral with checkmarks, X marks, and orange-highlighted key differentiators. These three changes target the highest-leverage conversion points in the funnel. |
| 2026-03-11 | No-CC trial + promotional pricing as Phase 151 | No-credit-card 7-day Pro trial on registration removes the biggest conversion barrier — users experience Pro features immediately. Trial tracked in users table (trial_start, trial_end, trial_used), effective plan computed dynamically in _user_dict() so JWT and middleware always see correct tier. Early adopter rates (Pro $59.99/yr first 500, Elite $99.99/yr first 200) with env-var feature flag and subscriber counting. Lifetime deals (Pro $249.99, Elite $399.99 one-time) use Stripe payment mode instead of subscription, with plan protection against subscription-delete webhooks. Pricing page dynamically loads promotions from /api/billing/promotions endpoint and renders EA/lifetime cards when enabled. All features gated behind env-var flags for controlled rollout. |
| 2026-03-11 | Trial onboarding as Phase 152 | Post-registration experience is the critical conversion window. Trial welcome banner in Sleeper prompt creates excitement ("Pro Trial Active"). Welcome state after connect/skip directs users to Situation Room or Lab instead of just closing the modal. Trial expiry banners at 2-day, 1-day, and expired thresholds create urgency without nagging — orange warning becomes red urgency becomes "trial ended" with pricing CTA. Trial badges on briefing cards and context mode make users aware they're using Pro features, creating loss aversion when trial ends. All annotations use plan_source === "trial" to avoid showing to paid users. |
| 2026-03-11 | Production readiness as Phase 153 | Preconnect hints for Google Fonts added to all 74 HTML pages (eliminates DNS lookup latency). JSON-LD structured data (WebApplication schema with pricing tiers) added to index.html for SEO. Bug fix: added missing _efficiency_grade() function to college.py — was causing 500 errors on /api/college/efficiency and /api/college/consistency endpoints. Full QA pass: 63/63 API endpoints verified, auth flow (register with 7-day trial, login, /me) verified end-to-end, all JS files pass syntax check, all 74 pages have nav elements, 5 static pages serve 200. |
