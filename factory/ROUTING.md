# Model Routing — Expensive Judgment, Cheap Throughput

The factory's economics: **frontier models decide, cheap models build.** This contract is harness-agnostic — Claude Code sessions, CI-triggered runs, or any future loop runner must honor it. No runner code ships in this repo.

## Frontier model (Opus-class) — judgment

Required for:

- Writing or changing anything in `spec/` or `factory/` (including gate definitions and this file).
- Slice planning: creating cards, reordering BACKLOG, splitting oversized cards, KILL calls.
- Taste review: T6 screenshot-gravity judgments, design-language calls, persona voice.
- Architecture: anything that would touch `spec/STACK.md`, add a dependency, or change the schema's shape beyond the active slice's stated scope.
- Reviewing a cheap-model slice before merge when the slice shipped a user-facing surface.

## Cheap model (Haiku/Sonnet-class) — throughput

Appropriate for:

- Executing an ACTIVE slice whose card has a complete scope fence and concrete G5 assertions.
- Mechanical ports, test writing against a stated contract, adapter implementations against `spec/DATA.md`.
- Gate-failure fix loops where the failure is local (failing test, lint, type error).

## Taste latitude

Frontier sessions have **explicit creative license** inside the rulebook: within `spec/DESIGN.md` and `spec/VOICE.md`, add taste, wit, and craft freely — margin notes, loading copy, the extra 10% that makes a surface screenshot-worthy. Don't ask permission to be excellent. The line: when a choice is **identity-load-bearing** (changes what Razzle *is* — a room's purpose, the free/paid line, the valuation philosophy, the mascot's character) and not derivable from `spec/`, surface it to the Founder instead of silently choosing. Liberties within the lines: take them. Liberties *with* the lines: discuss first.

## The escalation rule

A cheap-model session that hits a decision **not answerable from `spec/`** does not guess. It writes the question on the slice card, marks it BLOCKED, finishes what is safely in scope, and ends clean. A frontier session (or the Founder) answers on the card, flips it back to OPEN, and the next cheap session proceeds.

Signals you must escalate: the fix wants a new dependency · two specs appear to conflict · the slice needs a product call the card didn't make · the gate itself seems wrong.

## Budget (hard constraints)

- **Primary engine: the Founder's Claude subscription.** All routine factory work runs inside subscription-covered Claude Code sessions. Plan heavy slices for when the usage window is fresh (limits reset on ~5-hour windows); do frontier planning/review early in a window, then let cheap throughput burn the remainder.
- **API credits: $150 total, overflow only.** Spend them solely to *finish* something a session ran out of limits mid-way through — never to start work a future session could do. Log any API spend as a line in the STATE.md ledger row for that slice.
- A session that hits usage limits mid-slice commits what is green, marks the card with exactly what remains, and ends clean — the next session resumes from the card. Never leave the resume state in your head.

## Founder-only

- Posting anywhere public under the Founder's identity (Reddit, social).
- Pricing changes, billing live-mode, deleting data.
- Overriding a VETO condition from `spec/NORTH_STAR.md`.
- Providing credentials: LLM API keys, Stripe, Reddit. Everything else the factory handles itself; the Founder's standing role is veto power when direction gets weird.

## Cadence (suggested, not enforced by tooling)

One frontier planning pass keeps BACKLOG ordered and answers BLOCKED cards; cheap sessions burn down the top of BACKLOG one slice at a time; a frontier review pass audits shipped surfaces against T1–T7 every few slices. State lives in `factory/STATE.md` — any harness that reads it, honors the slice contract, and routes by this file can drive the factory.
