## BACKLOG

### S-001 nflverse-ingest [DONE]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Data (Explore L0 prerequisite) · **Trust:** T1 substrate
- **Goal:** `uv run python scripts/sync_data.py --quick` fills `players` + `player_week_stats` from nflverse for seasons 2024–2025; `GET /api/players` serves it.
- **File plan:**
  - NEW `apps/api/src/razzle_api/ingest/__init__.py` — docstring only.
  - NEW `apps/api/src/razzle_api/ingest/nflverse.py` — the adapter (fetch + map + upsert).
  - NEW `apps/api/src/razzle_api/services/players_service.py` — `list_players(session, position, limit)`.
  - NEW `apps/api/src/razzle_api/api/routers/players.py` + `api/schemas/players.py`.
  - EDIT `apps/api/src/razzle_api/main.py` — one import + one `include_router` line.
  - NEW `scripts/sync_data.py` — argparse CLI: `--quick` (seasons 2024+2025), `--seasons 2023 2024`, `--status` (print row counts + db file size, no fetch).
  - NEW `apps/api/tests/unit/test_nflverse_mapping.py`, `apps/api/tests/integration/test_players_api.py`.
- **Interfaces:**
  - `fetch_players() -> list[dict]` and `fetch_week_stats(season: int) -> list[dict]` — network only, no DB. Stdlib urllib + csv (+ gzip for `.gz`), `User-Agent: razzle-sync/1.0`, timeout 120s.
  - `map_week_row(row: dict) -> dict | None` — pure: one nflverse CSV row → our column dict, or None if filtered out. This is the unit-tested function.
  - `upsert_players(session, rows) -> int`, `upsert_week_stats(session, season, rows) -> int` — DB only, no network. SQLite upsert via `sqlalchemy.dialects.sqlite.insert(...).on_conflict_do_update(...)`; conflict targets: `gsis_id` / `(player_id, season, week)`.
  - `GET /api/players?position=RB&limit=100` → `{"players": [{"gsis_id", "name", "position", "team"}]}`, ordered by name; `limit` default 100, max 500.
- **Data contract:**
  - Players: `https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/download/players/players.csv` — take `gsis_id` (PK; skip rows without one), `display_name`→name, `position`, `latest_team`→team. Keep positions QB/RB/WR/TE only.
  - Weekly: release tag `stats_player`, file `stats_player_week_{season}.csv`, found via `https://api.github.com/repos/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases?per_page=100` (or direct download URL of the same shape as players). Keep rows where `season_type == "REG"` and position in QB/RB/WR/TE. **The weekly file's `player_id` column IS the gsis_id.**
  - Column map (nflverse → ours): `attempts`→pass_att · `completions`→pass_cmp · `passing_yards`→pass_yd · `passing_tds`→pass_td · `passing_interceptions` (older files: `interceptions`)→pass_int · `sacks_suffered` (older: `sacks`)→pass_sack · `passing_2pt_conversions`→pass_two_pt · `carries`→rush_att · `rushing_yards`→rush_yd · `rushing_tds`→rush_td · `rushing_2pt_conversions`→rush_two_pt · `targets`→target · `receptions`→rec · `receiving_yards`→rec_yd · `receiving_tds`→rec_td · `receiving_2pt_conversions`→rec_two_pt · fumble = `rushing_fumbles`+`receiving_fumbles`+`sack_fumbles` · fumble_lost = same three `_lost` columns · `special_teams_tds`→special_teams_td. All other schema columns stay 0.
  - Coercion: `""`/`"NA"`/`"NaN"`/None → 0.0; everything to float. The map must accept BOTH old and new column names (the 2025+ format renamed exactly: passing_interceptions, sacks_suffered, sack_yards_lost, team→recent_team).
- **Test plan:** unit — `map_week_row` on two literal fixture dicts (one new-format, one old-format names) asserts identical mapped output, NA→0.0, non-REG row → None. Integration — on a tmp migrated DB: upsert fixture players+stats twice, assert row counts identical both times (idempotency) and a known value survives; seed 3 players, `GET /api/players?position=RB` via ASGITransport returns the RBs only.
- **Gates:** G1–G4; G5 (paste outputs in commit body):
  - `uv run python scripts/sync_data.py --quick` → exit 0
  - `uv run python scripts/sync_data.py --status` → players ≥ 500, week-stat rows ≥ 10000, db size < 100MB
  - run `--quick` again, then `--status` → identical row counts
  - `curl -s 'localhost:8000/api/players?position=RB&limit=50' | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(len(json.load(sys.stdin)['players']))"` → ≥ 20
- **Out of scope:** kicking columns (stay 0), DST/IDP, return_yd/return_td (stay 0), college data, snap counts, injuries, schedules, storing nflverse's precomputed fantasy_points columns (we always compute from rules), any UI.
- **Pitfalls (verified against the legacy adapter, read-only ref: old razzle repo `legacy/adapters/nflverse_adapter.py`):** GitHub releases API requires a User-Agent header · players.csv uses BOM, decode `utf-8-sig` · don't trust `players.csv` team for identity (teams go stale), gsis_id only · keep `ingest/` importing the engine's column names from one place: define `STAT_COLUMNS` once (the migration already has the list — mirror it, don't import the migration).

### S-002 explore-screener [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Explore L0–L1 · **Trust:** T1, T6
- **Goal:** `/explore` screener — TanStack Table over `/api/players` stats, position filter, sortable columns, nuqs URL state, position colors, "pulling film..." loading state.
- **Scope:** `apps/web/src/app/explore/`, `apps/web/src/features/explore/`, API screener endpoint + service, tests.
- **Gates:** G1–G4; G5: ≥20 rows render, sort/filter updates URL, refresh preserves state, no 500s, tokens-only styling, screenshot attached.

### S-003 player-sheet-v0 [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Player Sheet · **Trust:** T3
- **Goal:** `/player/[gsis_id]` — header (name/team/position color), season + weekly stat table, prev/next player switch; every Explore row links here.
- **Scope:** `apps/web/src/app/player/`, `apps/web/src/features/player-sheet/`, players API detail endpoint, tests.
- **Gates:** G1–G4; G5: Explore row click lands on sheet, switching players feels instant, hallway check `playerIdentityConsistent`, screenshot.

### S-004 explore-custom-scoring [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Explore L3 · **Trust:** T1, T3
- **Goal:** Scoring preset picker (PPR/half/standard/TEP from `domain/scoring/presets.py`) + editable core rules; fantasy-points column computed server-side by `score_week` over real week stats.
- **Scope:** screener API (accept scoring config), `apps/web/src/features/explore/` controls, `apps/web/src/features/scoring-preview/` integration, tests.
- **Gates:** G1–G4; G5: points column changes when rules change, values match engine unit-test fixtures, URL carries the preset.

### S-005 valuation-workbench-v0 [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Lab L1–L3 (flagship; absorbs Launch-10 `vorp`) · **Trust:** T1, T5, T6
- **Goal:** `/lab/workbench` — the income approach made visible. VORP over a real season is the first model: assumptions panel (scoring config, replacement logic, league size) on the left, tier-colored value table on the right, values recompute live as assumptions change. Methodology note rendered beside the numbers ("how this value is built"). Octo header.
- **Scope:** `apps/web/src/app/lab/`, `apps/web/src/features/lab/`, valuation service wiring to real data, tests.
- **Gates:** G1–G4; G5: real top-200 renders, position ranks correct vs `test_vorp.py` logic, changing an assumption visibly moves values, links back to Player Sheet (hallway `crossRoomLinkPresent`), screenshot passes the r/DynastyFF test.

### S-006 sleeper-connect [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Bureau L0 · **Trust:** T2
- **Goal:** Sleeper username → league list → pick league; persist `LeagueConfig` (new `leagues` migration); context bar shows `@user · league`; workbench + screener default to the connected league's scoring.
- **Scope:** to be fenced by a frontier planning pass before activation.
- **Gates:** to be defined when fenced.

### S-007 trade-answer-card [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Explore/Lab (distribution) · **Trust:** T1, T6
- **Goal:** The canonical Reddit screenshot per the trade-reply doctrine (NORTH_STAR Distribution): a side-by-side trade comparison card — players/picks on each side, valued under a league's settings, key assumptions visible — exportable as image with Razzle colors and "razzle.lol" watermark. Plus plain watermarked export for screener/workbench views.
- **Scope:** to be fenced before activation (likely `/og/*` server-rendered routes + a compare view).
- **Gates:** to be defined when fenced; G5 must include: the card alone answers "who wins this trade?" without the reader needing the app.

### S-008 deploy [OPEN]
- **Pillar/Layer:** Infrastructure (launch gate) · **Trust:** —
- **Goal:** Fly.io API + web live on razzle.lol behind Cloudflare; weekly sync cron; founder provides DNS + keys.
- **Scope:** to be fenced before activation.
- **Gates:** to be defined when fenced.

> Post-launch queue (do not start before 2026-07-28 unless launch path is done): valuation model layers (positional age curves, team situation surplus/deficit, growth rates — the NORTH_STAR build sheet), consensus market values beside intrinsic values, Bureau Self-Scout + monitoring/prediction, Monte Carlo championship odds, injury intel feed + Dolphin timelines + champ-probability deltas, Situation Room ask flow, Stripe Pro tier.
